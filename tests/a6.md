& Sequence
& Series

& A "sequence" is a list of
  numbers
& A "series" represents a single number

& A "sequence" might contain a &em{finite} number
  of terms
& A "series" always contains &em{infinite} number
  of terms

& A "sequence" does not necessarily have to start with a term;
  for instance,
  "..., -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, ..."
& A "series" always have a &em{first term}
