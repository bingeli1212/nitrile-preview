[ External image ]

An external can be described by the phrase such as
``&img{tree.png}``. 

By default, the image will be typeset to occupy the maximum
available width of that paragraph. However, additional
arguments can be passed to express the width, aspect-ratio
of the image as well. For instance, if the image is to be
typeset at 90% of the current paragraph width, then
it would appear as ``&img{tree.png,width:90%}``.
If aspect ratio is also to be included, then it might
look like: ``&img{tree.png,width:90%,aspectratio:4/3}``.
