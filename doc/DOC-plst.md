title: The PLST block
---

The PLST block is designed to contain the entire
content that might consists of multiple itemized
or enumerated items as well as paragraphs attached
to any one of the items.

In order to be recognized as the start of a PLST block,
the first line of a markdown paragraph must start
with a hyphen, an asterisk, or a plus-sign, followed
by one or more spaces. Alternatively, it can also start
with two or more digits, followed by a period, and then
one or more spaces. Instead of two or more digits, it can
also with an ASCII letter lower case 'a' through 'z', 
or capital letter 'A' through 'Z'.
