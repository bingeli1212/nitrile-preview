title: Latex Temporary Files

# Q. What temp files generated by latex can I delete without risk?

You can delete all of them whenever needed, typically when you are
finished with a project. But since some of them store things that are
used on subsequent compilations (e.g. citations, cross-references,
tables of contents etc.) it's generally advisable to keep them around
unless they need to be deleted due to some error. See Will cruft from
a previous compile ever change the final look of my document for more
discussion (duplicate?). – Alan Munn Aug 29 '18 at 15:43

You also can ask the compiler to run the compiler with the switch,
say, --aux-directory=./TeXAux, which will store most of the auxiliary
files in a TeXAux subdirectory of the current directory (and will
create one if there is no such directory so far). – Bernard Aug 29 '18

TexnicCenter has a Build->Clean Project option which will delete all
the temp files for you. – John Kormylo Aug 29 '18 at 16:54
