title: Flowchart
---

A flowchart is a picture of the separate steps of a process in sequential
order. It is a generic tool that can be adapted for a wide variety of
purposes, and can be used to describe various processes, such as a
manufacturing process, an administrative or service process, or a project
plan. It's a common process analysis tool and one of the seven basic quality
tools. 

# WHEN TO USE A FLOWCHART

```     
- It helps to clarify complex processes.
- It identifies steps that do not add value to the internal or external customer, including delays; needless storage and transportation; unnecessary work, duplication, and added expense; breakdowns in communication.
- It helps team members gain a shared understanding of the process and use this knowledge to collect data, identify problems, focus discussions, and identify resources.
- It serves as a basis for designing new processes.
```     

# FLOWCHART BASIC PROCEDURE

Materials needed: Sticky notes or cards, a large piece of flipchart paper or newsprint, and marking pens.

```     
- Define the process to be diagrammed. Write its title at the top of the work surface.
- Discuss and decide on the boundaries of your process: Where or when does the process start? Where or when does it end? Discuss and decide on the level of detail to be included in the diagram.
- Brainstorm the activities that take place. Write each on a card or sticky note.
- Arrange the activities in proper sequence.
- When all activities are included and everyone agrees that the sequence is correct, draw arrows to show the flow of the process.
- Review the flowchart with others involved in the process (workers, supervisors, suppliers, customers) to see if they agree that the process is drawn accurately.
```     

# FLOWCHART CONSIDERATIONS

```     
- Donâ€™t worry about drawing the flowchart the "right way." Ultimately, the right way is the way that helps those involved understand the process.
- Identify and involve in the flowcharting process all key people involved with the process. This includes suppliers, customers, and supervisors. Involve them in the actual flowcharting sessions by interviewing them before the sessions and/or by showing them the developing flowchart between work sessions and obtaining their feedback.
- Do not assign a "technical expert" to draw the flowchart. People who actually perform the process should do it.

## COMMONLY USED SYMBOLS IN DETAILED FLOWCHARTS

```     
- ROUNED RECTANGLE: Symbols for start and end points.
- ARROW: Direction of flow from one step or decision to another.
- RECTANGLE: A rectangle represent an interim step. The text inside the box explains the process. Usually, only one rrow goes out of the box.
- DIAMOND: A diamond represents a decision point; lines coming into the diamond represents the external impetus; lines oming out of the diamond represents decisions, each of which should lead to another process or another decision point.
- PARALLELGRAM: It represents external information entering or leaving the system; an example input would be a sales rder from a customer; an example output can be a product to be delivered to the customer.
- DOCUMENT: A document symbol represents a document recording point where information will be logged, such as to an nternal database system, or a paper printout, etc.
- OVAL: This symbol would contain a letter inside. It indicates that the flow continues on a matching symbol containing he same letter somewhere else on a different page.
- BUTT: Delay or wait or bottleneck.
