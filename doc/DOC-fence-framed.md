title: The framed fence
---

The "framed" fence would have setup a "framed" picture
showing the content of the block.

    ```framed
    The text inside this fenced
    area is to be shown with fixed
    width font. It is designed to 
    behave like a vector graph so that
    it will be shrinked or expanded
    to the fullest width of the paragraph.
    ```
