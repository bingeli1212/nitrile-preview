title: Produce Fitting Pages

# The \startTEXpage command

Normally you would produce PDF pages with \starttext command.
The text placed between the \starttext and \endtext commands would
be paginated and their contents being used to produce enough PDF
pages to hold these contents.

    \showframe
    \startTEXpage
    asdf
    \stopTEXpage
    
This would produce a page that is just large enough to 
hold the string "asdf". Following is another example.

    \showframe
    \startTEXpage[offset=10pt]
    asdf
    \stopTEXpage
    
This would produce a page that is slightly larger
than the one done by the previous example. This page would 
have a 10pt padding between the text and the four edges of the
page.

    \setuppapersize[A10,landscape]
    \showframe[]
    \starttext
    asdf
    \stoptext
    
This previous command would have produced a page that is
exactly the same size as a A10 paper.


# The \startMPpage command

This command and the command \stopMPpage is to produce a single PDF
page that is the same size as the picture that is just big enough
to hold the drawing done by the MP commands between these two commands.

    \starttext
    \startMPpage
      draw fullcircle scaled 2cm ;
      dotlabel.bot(textext("(0,0)"),origin);
    \stopMPpage
    
    \stopMPpage
      draw fullcircle scaled 2cm ;
      drawarrow (0,0)--(1cm,0) ;
      label.bot(textext("$r$"),(5mm,0)) ;
    \stopMPpage
    \stoptext
    
See figure &ref{pages:mppage} for the drawings of the two pages
generated by the previous program.
