A diagram block is to generate a diagram with vector based figures,
made up with vector based components as lines, circles, rectangles,
arrows, dots, etc. The goal of using a diagram block versus using an
raster based image such as PNG or JPEG is that a vector based diagram
provides much better resolution especially when the diagram is printed
on a piece of paper.


# Using MetaPost with LuaLatex

A diagram block is to be translated into an inline MetaPost block
between ``\begin{mplibcode}`` and ``\end{mplibcode}``. This environment is
supported by the ``luamplib`` LATEX package.

    \usepackage{luamplib}

The color syntax is either the color name, such as "red", "green", or
RGB such as "rgb(200,100,25)".

The MetaPost code has the provision to allow for a "xcolor" provided
by the "xcolor" package, such as using the ``\mpcolor`` macro. Thus,
the MetaPost command can be set up as

    draw (1,2)--(2,3) withpen pencircle withcolor \mpcolor(gray)

The xcolor package has also expanded the avialble color names to more
than what's provided by MetaPost, including "gray", "orange", etc.
Following additional color names are always provided by the xcolor
package:

    red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, yellow, black, gray, white,
    darkgray, lightgray, brown, lime, olive, orange, pink,
    purple, teal, violet

SVG also allows for a color to be specified directly using RGB, such
as

    <line x1='0' y1='1' x2='2' y2='3' stroke='rgb(200,100,25)'/>

MetaPost allow for expressing a color using three integers as RGB values of a
color such as '(0.94,0.2,0.1)' where each RGB value is to be expressed as a
floating point number between 0-1.  In addition, it does not have provision
such that you can create a new color name with a customized RGB values in it,
such as

    definecolor{ultramarine}{RGB}{0,32,96}
    definecolor{wrongultramarine}{rgb}{0.07, 0.04, 0.56}

The \definecolor is a macro provided by xcolor package. This means if a color
is specified as "rgb(200,100,25)" then a \definecolor command must first be
called to create a "unique" color name, such as "mycolor003" which is to be
placed outside of the "mplibcode" environment, in order for this particular
color to be referenced inside "mplibcode" environment. Therefore, currently
MetaPost translation does not support specifying color using RGB directly.

Note that MetaPost does allow for a color mixing using existing color names
such as

    draw (1,2)--(2,3) withpen pencircle withcolor \mpcolor(red!80!white!20!)

Note that for units such as line width, dot size, etc, is maintained internally
by Diagram as the SVG user unit. One user unit is exactly 1/96 of an inch.
Following is the conversion of SVG units.

    1in = 96px
    1in = 72pt
    1in = 2.54cm

It seems that MetaPost allows for a line length or dot size to be expressed
without a specific unit attached to it. For example, you can ask to draw a dot
by MetaPost with the following command. The "withpen pencircle scaled 5" is
part of a configuration to the "dot" command that is to tell it to use a pen
size of 5. Note that the size of 5 is interpreted as the size of the pen,
therefore, the diameter of the dot as the pen is a circle pen.

    dot (22*u,3*u) withpen pencircle scaled 5 ;

You can also provide a unit directly, such as pt.

    dot (22*u,3*u) withpen pencircle scaled 5pt ;

The linecap attribute is defines the shape to be used at the end of open
subpaths when they are stroked. The SVG has an attribute that can used for
line-element. The available values are: 'butt', 'round', and 'square'. The
default value is 'butt'.



# Using MetaFun with ConTeXt 

For CONTEX the MetaPost is called MetaFun, which is a variant that is
based on MetaPost by has been modified by Hans Hagen. The syntax of
MetaFun and MetaPost are mostly compatible, but there are differences.
One different is that MetaFun supports transparent colors, while
MetePost does not. In TexLive2020 distribution the 'label' command for
MetaFun requires quotation marks rather than btex and etex for its
first argument.

    \startMPcode
    ...
    \stopMPcode


# The SVG translation

A diagram will be converted to an embedded SVG for a HTML translation.
It is then converted to a DATA URI for a img-element.

    <img alt="diagram" src="data:img/svg+xml;charset=UTF-8,${encodeURIComponent(text)}" />
    
Note that the quotation-mark must be used to wrap the 'src' attribute
values because apostrophy (single-quote) is a valid coded character
returned by the 'encodeURIComponent()' function.

There is an outstanding issues on SVG,
the arrowhead MARKER-element does not change the color with the line
it is attached to, and is always shown as black.


# An example diagram

Following is an example of a diagram block.

    % variables
    \path a = (1,1) -- (5,5) -- (5,1) -- (1,1) 
    \path b = (1,1) .. (5,5) .. (5,1) .. (1,1) 
    % draw
    \draw  &a
    \draw  &b


# Viewport

In Diagram, each figure is always expresses using the grid unit
length. A unit unit length is considered as a distance between two
adjacent grid lines on a graphing paper for which a length of 1
corresponds to the width of a single grid.

In Diagram a grid is drawn as the background by default. The size of
the grid is 20 grid units length long in the horizontal direction and
10 grid unit length long in the vertical directon. You can change that
by setting viewport configuration setting

    ```diagram{viewport:20 10}
    ```

Each grid is by default 5mm in length, thus, a total of 20 grid units
in horizontal direction will generate an image of 200mm in width, and
10 grid units of vertical direction will put the image in the height
of 100mm. To set the unit to a different length, include the third argument
as the viewport-option. For example, to set the viewport to the previous
width and height and such that each grid is 6mm-by-6mm, do the following. 

    ```diagram{viewport:20 10 6}
    ```

By default the grid lines are drawn for each grid. Thus, a grid of 20 by 10
would have seen a total of 21 vertical lines and 11 horizontal lines. However,
it is also possible to skip drawing some grids lines, ie., to draw grid lines
every other grids. In this case the fouth argument of the 'viewport' would be an
integer expressing how many grids to cover for each grid line. By default it is
set to 1 but it could be set to other numbers such as 2 which would asks that a
grid line is drawn for every two grids, both in horizontal and vertical
directions.

    ```diagram{viewport:20 10 6 2}
    ```

    
# Non-action commands

Action command are those that would generate a translation such as those metafun
commands, tikz commands, or SVG entries. Example action commands are 'draw',
'drawtext', 'drawdot', etc.

Non-action commands are those that is used to configure environments, create and
update variables, function, and path, etc. Following are Non-action commands:

- \var
- \for
- \if
- \path
- \fn
- \config
- \exit
- \group
- \origin
- \show
    


# The 'config' command

The config command can be used to control the configuration parameters
for the entire Diagram. This set includes the previous discussed
viewport width and height, and the unit.

However, there are additional configuration parameters. These
parameters should be set at the beginning of the Diagram, before any
drawing commands, in order to maintain consistencies. Changing these
configuration parameters in the middle of other drawing commands are
not recommended and may result in distorted picture.

    \config linesize 1
    \config linecolor red


# Specifying colors

The colors in the DIAGRAM can be specified in several ways. The easiest is to
use a named color, such as "red", "green", "blue", etc.  The second is to use
RGB, such as "#CCC", "#ABABAB", etc.  The third way is to use color function
such as "hwb(30|10%|20%)" or "rgb(255|0|0)". 

    red
    green
    #CCC
    #ABABAB
    @hwb(30|10%|20%)
    @rgb(255|0|0)
    @hsl(0|100%|50%)



# Gradient fill

The Gradient fill is provided by SVG, TikZ and MetaFun. 

In general, there are two gradient fills, "linear" and "radial". 
The first is to fill a gradient from one side of the figure
to another, and the second one is to fill the gradient
from a point inside the figure, usually the center, and move
concentrically away from that point.

For SVG, to do that is to define a 'linearGradient' or 'radialGradient' 
element, assign it a id, and then place this element inside a 
'defs' block. When a shape such as a rectangle need to be filled with
this pattern, it will set the 'fill=' attribute of this rectangle
with a url, such as 'fill=url(#myid)', assuming that 'myid' is the 
id of the 'linearGradient' or 'radialGradient' element.

For TikZ, it is to use the '\shade' command, rather than the
'\fill' command. Within this command, there are several option
we need to set. First of all, the 'shading=' option. This option
is to be set with a string that is either 'axis', or 'radial'. 
It can also be set to 'ball', which acts like a 'radial' but will
move the center point of the inner color away from the center
of the shape towards some hardcoded point that is the north-west
location within the shape.

When 'shading=' is set to 'axis', there are three options we
can set, namely "top color=", "bottom color=", and "midddle color=". 
The first two defines "from color" and "to color", and the last one
defines a "middle color that sits between the first two colors. 
The last one can be omitted, in which case the color will simply 
flow from the "top color" to the "bottom color". 

By default TikZ flows color from top to bottom. However, you can
change it to flow a different direction by setting the "angle=" option. 
This takes a number that is from 0-90, denoting an angle rotating
anti-clockwise. Thus, when "angle=90" the color flow will be from
left to right. 

When "shading=" is set to "radial", then the two color choices
will be "inner color=" and "outer color=". There is no other options
to set.

When "shading=" is set to "ball", there is only color to
set and this one is "ball color=".
This color defines the color of the ball. With this gradient it is better
to apply it to a circular shape, although other shapes 
are also allows. Tikz will apply a gradient to the shape to simulate
the effect of having a light at the top-left hand corner of the ball.

For MetaFun it offers linear gradient and radial gradient as well.
For linear gradient the 'withshademethod "linear"' must be specified.
The 'withshadedirection' option specifies the direction of flow of the color.

    withshadedirection (0.5, 2.5) // bottom-to-top
    withshadedirection (2.5, 0.5) // top-to-bottom
    withshadedirection (1.5, 3.5) // right-to-left
    withshadedirection (3.5, 1.5) // left-to-right

Basically for MetaFun each quardrant is assigned a number 1, thus, rotating 
an be achieved by adding 1/90 (approx. 0.011) to the two coordinates of the 'withshadedirection='
for every one degree turned anti-clockwise. For example, when top-to-bottom color
flow is (2.5, 0.5), the flow that is one-degree rotated anti-clockwise will result
in a coordinates pair of (2.511, 0.511).

For linear gradient, there can be one color, two colors, and three colors, which
is supported by TikZ. For SVG the actual number of colors choices can be more. 
For MetaFun it is also possible to specify three or more colors. However, in order
to maintain backward compatibility with TikZ, only three colors will be supported
for linear gradient. For MetaFun, when three colors are used for linear gradient,
the MetaFun code will look like the following:

    withshadestep( 
      withshadefraction .5 
      withshadecolors(\MPcolor{yellow},\MPcolor{blue})
    )
    withshadestep( 
      withshadefraction 1 
      withshadecolors(\MPcolor{blue},\MPcolor{red})
    )

Assuming the top color is yellow, middle one being blue,
and the bottom one being red. If there are only two colors, 
then it will look like

    withshadestep( 
      withshadefraction 1 
      withshadecolors(\MPcolor{blue},\MPcolor{red})
    )

In this case, the top color is blue and bottom color is red,
assuming the color flows from top to bottom, where in reality the
flow direction is controlled by the 'withshadedirection'
directive. For radial gradient, the syntax for MetaFun
is a little different:

    withshademethod "circular"
    withshadefactor 1
    withshadedomain(0,2)
    withshadecolors(\MPcolor{blue},\MPcolor{red})

Will allow the radial gradient to look similar to those of SVG
and/or TikZ. Note the presence of 'withshadefactor' and 'withshadedomain'.
Not certain how they actually do the job behind the scene but 
choice of these numbers seems to work the magic of generating
the effect similar to those of SVG and/or TikZ.

For 'shade:ball', the following commands are hardcoded:

    withshademethod "circular"
    withshadecenter(-0.45,0.35)
    withshadedomain(0,1.5)
    withshadestep( 
      withshadefraction .25 
      withshadecolors(\MPcolor{white},\MPcolor{blue})
    )
    withshadestep( 
      withshadefraction  1 
      withshadecolors(\MPcolor{blue},\MPcolor{black}) 
    )

To simulate the effect of "shade:ball" on SVG, the 
'radialGradient' element is filled with the following
attributes:

    <radialGradient 
      id="..."     
      cx="0.5"     
      cy="0.5"     
      fx="0.3"     
      fy="0.4"     
      r="0.5"     
      <stop offset="0%" stop-color="white"/> 
      <stop offset="100%" stop-color="lightgray"/> 
    </radialGradient>

For Diagram, the 'shade:linear', 'shade:radial', and 'shade:ball' allows for
three different kind of gradient fills similar to linear, radial, and ball
offerd by TikZ. 

The 'shadecolor:' option holds a list of colors separated by spaces denoting
how a gradient is to flow from the first color the last.  The appearance
of the gradient depends on the choice of the 'shade' option. 

For 'shade:linear' up to three colors can be listed, and the gradient is a flow
of these three colors going through each one of the in order given.  If there
are two colors, the flow is to be between these two colors.  If only one color
is present, then flow is assumed to be between that color and black. If no
color is found, the flow is assumed to be from white to black.

For 'shade:radial', only the first two color of the 'shadecolor' option is
recognized, and the flow is to happen between these two colors. If only one
color is found, this becomes the first color and the second one is assumed to
be black.  In the absence of 'shadecolor', the flow is assumed to be between
white and black.

For 'shade:ball', only the first color of 'shadecolor' option is recognized,
which is color of the ball. If no color is found, the color of the ball is
assumed to be "gray".

There is also another issue. For SVG and TikZ when gradient fill is selected,
the color will flow from inner to outer color uniformly in both horizontal
and vertical directions. If the filled shape is a rectangle with a longer    
width than height, then the color flow at the horizontal direction will be elongated
than the color flow at the vertical direction because the width is longer than
height. However, for MetaFun this is
not the case, the color flow always seems to be uniform in all directions.
The outer color seems to be at a location away from the inner
color that is the average of the half width and half height of the rectangle.


# Valid symbol names

Symbol names includes those names referenced as a path, a scalar variable, 
a scalar array, and a user-defined function. 

A valid symbol name must start with an upper case letter
or lower case letter, and followed by additional letters or numbers.
Underscores are not part of a symbol names, and in some cases recognized
as a way to express subindex to access individual elements.
For instance, "a", "aa", "a0" are valid symbol names, 
while "0", "0a", "0ab", "_ab", "ab_", are "a_b" are not valid symbol names.

Following example shows how to access the second path point of a path named "a" when
constructing a path "b".

    \path a = (1,2)--(3,4)
    \path b = (&a_1)

Following example shows how to access the second point of an array named "a" in a scalar
expression. 

    \var a[] = 1 2 3 4
    \var b = a_1

Following example shows how to access the entire content of the array "a" when building
another array named "b".

    \var a[] = 1 2 3 4
    \var b[] = [@a]




# Constructing a path

## Vector path

In graphics design, a vector path is defined as a collection of smooth or straight (vector) lines 
that follows one another. Each vector path should start with a M point,
followed by additional L, C, Q, or A points. If this path is closed, the last point is
a z point.

+ M
  The first point of a vector path.
+ L
  The previous point should connect to this point forming a straight line.
+ C
  The previous point should connect to this point forming a cubic Bezier curve.
+ Q
  The previous point should connect to this point forming a quadratic Bezier curve.
+ A
  The previous point should connect to this point forming an arc.
+ z
  Expresses that the current vector path should be "closed", connecting the last point
  to the first.

The previous definitions of various points is closely relatived to the letter
given to each point inside a SVG-path element.


## Path expression

If a vector path is allowed to be defined as to always start with a M point and
end in an optional z point, then a path expression of Diagram would be
considered a container that holds one or more vector paths, with other
information such as config options and text strings.

A path expression in Diagram would appear as part of many commands, such as
'path', 'draw', 'stroke', 'fill', 'drawdot', 'drawlabel', etc. In the following
example the path "a" would have composed of a single vector path and path "b"
would have composed of two vector paths.

    \path a = (0,0)--(1,1) 
    \path b = (0,0)--(3,4) (2,2)--(5,6)

A path expression in Diagram also include other information such as config
options and text strings. In the following example a path expression has
included two config options and two text strings.

    \draw (0,0)--(3,4) (2,2)--(5,6) {linesize:2,linecolor:red} "Hello" "World"

Config options are recognized by a set of braces, and within it could be one or
more options each of which a value for that option. Text string are instead
recognized by a pair of quotation marks. All config options detected in the same
path expression are merged to become a single map with each option an entry in
this map. On the other hand all text strings are grouped into an array, and the
order of each string follows the same order as they appear in the command. The
two vector path becomes individual path points that are grouped into an array
called a coords array.


## Coords array and coords points

A coords array is an array, and each element is called a coords point.  
In following example there are 2 coords points for path "a", and four coords
points for path "b".

    \path a = (0,0)--(1,1) 
    \path b = (0,0)--(3,4) (2,2)--(5,6)

A vector path inside a coords array is considered to always started from a M
point, progressing through other points until a z point or another M point is
enountered, at which it ends. A 'z' point becomes the last part of that vector
path, and a 'M' point would become the first point of a subsequent vector path.
The coords points after a 'z' point and before a 'M' point is not considered
part of a vector path. They will be ignored by commands such as 'draw',
'stroke', 'fill', 'arrow', 'revarrow', and 'dblarrow', each of which works with
a vector path.

Many commands do not work with vector paths, they work with coords points. For
instance, 'drawdot' works with coords points so that for each coords point with
a positional information, a dot will be placed at that location. All coords
points have positional information except for 'z' points.

Some commands would also work with text strings found in a path expression. For
instance, 'drawtext' would draw each text strings of a path expression at a
location identified by a coords point in the same order as they appear in the
command line. The 'drawanglearc' would treat each text strings as describing the
angle and thus would draw them inside the angle if possible.

The config options typically contains information such as line size, line color,
font size, font color, fill color, shades, etc. These options serves to provide
additional tuning for the ppearance of graphics exported by each command. Each
of the option has a default value if it is specified.



## Absolute and relative points

A coords point is considered an absolute point if they appear inside a pair of
parentheses, or a relative point if they appear inside a pair of brackets.

    \path a = (0,3)--(10,3)
    \path b = (0,3) [h:7]

In the previous example, (0,3), (10,3) are absolute points, and [h:7] is a
relative point. A absolute point only provides location information. By default
each one of them is to become a 'M' point, unless there is a "join" that tells
it otherwise.

A "join" is a piece of text that tells how a subsequent absolute point is to
join the previous point to beome something that is not a 'M' point. They are to
be identified by the appearance of "--", "~~", or ".." inside a path expression.

The appearance of "--" is called a "line-join". It turns the next absolute point
into a 'L' point. The "~~" is a "abr-join", and it turns the next absolute point
into a 'Q' point. The ".." is a "hobby-join", and it turns the next absolute
point into a 'C' point.

A relative point such as [h:7] contains both positional information as well as
instructions as how this point is to be joint by the one before it. For
instance, [h:7] would ask that the current point be turned into a 'L' point that
is located 7 grid distances to the right. As a general pattern, all relative
points start with an instruction, such as "h" in this case, followed by a colon,
and then additional numbers each of which separated by a comma. In addition, all
positional informations in a relative point will be expresses as "relative
distances" from the point before it. For instance, the "7" after the "h" means a
horizontal distance of 7 grid units to the right. If "7" were to be replaced by
"-7", then it would mean a horizontal distance of 7 grid units to the left
instead.




## The hobby-join

A hobby-join works with a collection of absolute points with the intent to
produce a series of cubic Bezier that goes through all of them.

    \path a = (0,0)..(2,0)..(2,2)

In the previous example there will be a cubic Bezier curve connecting between
the first two points, as well as another one connecting the last two. These
Bezier points are automatically calculated so that they look "smooth" when going
from one to another.

There is no limit to the total number of points that can be joint by a
hobby-join. However, for a curved line there should be at least three points and
they must not be "colinear".



## The qbezier-join

The qbezier-join would join two absolute path points by the virtual of a quardratic 
Bezier curve. The control point of the curve is to be expressed relative to
the 'lastpt' location.

    \path a = (0,0)|qbezier:4,-1|(5,5)

The previous example would have joint two path points by a quardratic Bezier curve
with control point at (4,-1).


## The cbezier-join

The cbezier-join would join two absolute path points by the virtual of a cubic 
Bezier curve. The first control point of the curve is to be expressed relative to
the 'lastpt' location, and the second control point is to be expressed relative
to the 'new' location.

    \path a = (0,0)|cbezier:4,-1,0,-5|(5,5)

The previous example would have joint two path points by a cubic Bezier curve
with first control point at (4,-1) and the second control point at (5,0).


## The veer-join 

An veer-join instructs that a curved line to be drawn between two points. This
curved line is typically a quadratic Bezier curve, make the next point a Q
point.

    \path a = (0,3)|veer:30|(10,3) 

This parameter is a number that denotes a rotation angle in degrees. Here are
the steps. First, a straight line is to be formed first between the two points.  
Then, this line is to be rotated around the first point in a clockwise rotation
direction that equals the angle in dgrees, or 30 in this case. Then, another
separate rotation is to be done with the same straight line but it would be
rotated around the second point and in a counter-clockwise rotation for the same
angle, 30 degrees. Each rotations would each have produced a ray and the control
point of the quadratic Bezier curve is where these two rays meet.

A positive number would means for the first point to
rotate clockwise and the second point to rotate counter-clockwise. And a
negative number would have meant for either one of them to do the other way.




## Other relative points

Following are descriptions of other relative points.

- [l:dx,dy] 
- [h:dx]
- [v:dy] 

These three relative points would each create a L path point, where the position
of the new point is relative to the previous point by a horizontal distance of
'dx' and a vertical distance 'dy'.

- [a:rx,ry,angle,bigarcflag,sweepflag,dx,dy] 

This is to create a A point that is dx/dy away from the current point. The arc
is assumed to trace alone an elliptical arc with x-axis and y-axis each of which
having a radius of 'rx' and 'ry'. The angle is in the unit of degrees,
specifying the rotation of the ellipse if any, with a positive number denoting a
counter-clockwise rotation. The 'bigarcflag' is set to 1 if the arc to be drawn
are the longer of the two between the starting point and end point. Otherwise
the shorter arc is to be drawn. The 'sweepflag' expresses whether the arc is to
travel counterclockwise or clockwise from the current point to the new point;
the value 0 is for a anti-clockwise rotation and the value 1 is for a clockwise
rotation. Thus, to draw an arc from the last point to a new point that is on its
right hand side of the last point, and if the sweepflag is set to 0, then the
arc will always appear below both points.

- [c:dx1,dy1,dx2,dy2,dx,dy] 

This is to create a C point from the current point to the new point that is
dx/dy away. The (dx1,dy1), and (dx2,dy2) are two control points, and its value
are relative distances from the previous point.  

- [s:dx2,dy2,dx,dy] 

This is to create a Q point that is dx/dy away from the previous point. Only the
second point of the current Bezier curve needs to be provided. The first control
point is deduced from the second control point of the previous cubic Bezier
curve operation. If the previous operation is not a cubic Bezier curve drawing,
but a quadratic Bezier curve drawing, then the first control point of the
quadratic curve is used to deduce the first control point of the current
operation. If it is neither a cubic nor a quadrilatic, then the last point is
assumed.

- [q:dx1,dy1,dx,dy] 
	
This is to draw a Q point that is dx/dy away from the previous point. The
(dx1/dy1) is the only control point, the values of which are relative distances
from the previous point.

- [t:dx,dy] 

This is to create a Q point that is dx/dy away from the previous point. No
control points for this point is necessary. It will be deduced from a previous
Bezier curve operation. If a previous operation is not a Bezier curve operation,
then the last point is assumed to be control point, in which case the drawn
curve will be straight line.

- [angledist:30,1] 
- [angledist:30,1,2,2] 

This is to create a new L point. The [angledist:30,1] directive is to construct
a new line segment from the current point to a new location that is 1 unit
distance away and 30 degrees counter-clockwise rotation from due east.

The [angledist:30,1,1,1] directive is similar to the one before except for the
fact that the 30 degree rotation is now to start from a non-zero degree angle
that is formed between the reference point (1,1) and the current point: if the
current point is (0,0) then the reference angle is 45 degrees, such that the
constructed line segment is to land at a point that is 75 degrees rotation from
due east.

- [turn:30,1] 

This is to create a new L point that is equivalent to making a left hand turn of
30 degrees from the direction you have arrived at the current point, and then
travel for one more unit length. If it is to make a right hand turn, then set
the angle to a negative number.

- [clock:30,1]
- [clock:30,1,4,0]

This is to create a new L point that is away from the current point in a
direciton described by the angle, where angle 0 is straight north, and 90 degree
is to the right hand side, -90 to the left hand side, and 180 is due south. The
first argument is the angle, and the second one is the distance away from the
current point.

If there are a total of four arguments, then the last two arguments represents
the x/y coordinates of a point from which the base angle is to be computed. The
base angle is the angle formed between the due north line and the line between
the current point and the new point. The clock angle is then being added on top
of the base angle before used to figure out the new location.

- [flip:1,3] 

This is to construct a new L point that is the mirror image of the given point
that is 1 grid distance to the right and 3 grid distance upwards from the
current point. The exact location of the new location depends on the last two
points traveled, the direction of which is treated as a mirror to which the new
point will be reflected upon. The net result could be thought of as folding a
paper along the line of the mirror with a point on one side of the line, and see
where that point will land on the other side of the line after folding. The new
point would be added as a "L" point.

- [sweep:cx,cy,angd] 

This is to construct a new A point of a given radius. The center of the arc is
cx/cy away from the current point. The radius of the arc is automatically
calculated to be the distance between the current point and the arc center. The
'angd' argument denotes the "arc measure" in degree, where a positive number
expresses that the sweep should happen in a counter-clockwise direction, and a
negative value expresses a clockwise sweep.

- [protrude:dist] 

This is to create a new L point. This new point is located at a distance that is
'dist' away from the current point. The direcion of the new point follows the
same direction going from the second last point to the last point. Thus, it is
important that there are at least two path points prior to creating this path
point.

- [ellipse:dx,dy,sweepflag] 

This is to create a new C point. This new point is located at a distance that
is 'dx/dy' away from the current point. The cubic Bezier simulates a quarter of
the arc on a full ellipse, and will always be drawn from the current point to
the new point as a sweep that is counter-clockwise. The "sweepflag" is to
express the direction of the sweep. It should be set to 0 when a anti-clockwise
sweep is desired.  If a clockwise sweep is desired, set the "sweepflag" to 1.

- [m:dx,dy]

This is to create a new 'M' point or update an existing 'M' point. The new 'M"
point will be moved dx/dy away from the current point. If the last point is not
a M point, a new M point will be created. Otherwise, the last M point is updated
and its new position is dx/dy away from its current position.



## Other aboluste points

Besizes the absolute points that are described by a pair of numbers, we can also
describe an abolute point whose locations are those of an existing object, such
as a node. For instance, we can construct a path that goes from (0,0) to the
center of an existing node of Id "1" as follows.

    \path (0,0)--(#node:1)

Here, the absolute point inside a pair parentheses starts with a number-sign,
followed by the word "node", followed by a period, and the Id of the node. This
same pattern extends to describing the location of a box as well.

    \path (0,0)--(#box:1)

For a node its location is always the center, and for a box its location is
always the left-left corner of the box. However, the previous notation also
includes provision to allow us to express a different part of the shape. For
instance, we can express that instead of drawing to the center of the node, we
want to draw to a point that borders the northmost tip of the shape. This, is
done by adding an "anchor-point" notation after the Id.

    \path (0,0)--(#node:1:o12)

Here, "o12" is a standard "anchor-point" that is defined for a node. For a node
there are twelve anchor points, namely "o1" to "o12". Each number after the
letter "o" corresponds to the locations of hours of the long hand for an analog
clock. For instance, anchor "o12" would denote a point that borders the north
tip of the node, and "o3" the east.

For a box, the anchor points are the following: "n", "w", "e", "w", "nw", "ne",
"sw" and "se". Thus, to draw a line between the two northen tips of the boxes we
would do the following:

    \draw (#box:1:n)--(#box:2:n)

If addition numbers are to be placed after, they will be interpreted as the
"offset" from that anchor point.

    \draw (#box:1:n)--(#box:1:n,2,3)

The previous example would draw line that starts out from the north tip of the
box, to another point that is 2 grid unit to the right and 3 grid units upwards.

The lastest addition of the "car" command has also created a new notation for
designating a point inside a Cartesian plane. The following example would draw a
line connecting two points of a Cartesian plane of Id "1" that is (3,4) and
(4,5).

    \car.1 (5,5)
    \draw (#car:1,3,4)--(#car:1,4,5)



## Coords point from another coords

Note that a 'path' command allows a coords array to be saved under a given name.
This also means that we can retrieve a point of a coords array that is currently
saved and use it to build a new path. Following example would set it so that the
second point of "b" is the same as the second point of "a".

    \path a = (0,0)--(3,4)
    \path b = (1,1)--(&a_1)



## Pasting path points

Notice that there are two different ways of referencing an existing path or path
points: the one with parentheses, and the one without. The second method allows
an existing path or path points to be copied and pasted into a new path without
modification.

    \path a = (0,0)[l:3,4] 
    \path b = (2,2)[l:3,4]
    \path c = &a &b

In the previous example, the path "a" and "b" would each have described a single
vector path of two points, and the path "c" would have had composed of these two
independent vector paths and a total of 4 points, with the first two coming from
"a" and the last two coming from "b".

This is made possible because the expression of ``&a`` and ``&b`` without the
parentheses around it instructs that all path points of "a" and "b" be copied
without modification and pasted directly into "c".

Depending on the situation, it could be dangrous and error prone when "pasting"
path points directly from another path, instead of "building" it locally. For
instance, in the following example the second path point of "a" would become the
first path point of "c" without modification.

    \path a = (0,0)--(3,4)--(4,5)
    \path c = &a_1 &a_2

This would become a problem because the second point of path "a" is a 'L' point,
and it retains this type after being "pasted" to "c", making the first point of
"c" a L point. This would have caused a problem when this path is to be scanned
for a vector path as there isn't a 'M' point to start a vector path.

However, had we constructed path "c" the following way the second point of "a"
would have would have become a 'M' point in path "c".

    \path a = (0,0)--(3,4)--(4,5) 
    \path c = (&a_1)--(&a_2)



## Close a path

When a vector path is closed it means when an outline is drawn for this path a
straight line is always drawn connecting the last point of this point with its
first point. This would give the illusion of having a "closed" area that is
"inside" the path, giving rise to the possibility of filling this area with a
color and/or a gradient.

The syntax for expressing a "closed" vector path is to add ``[z]`` after the
last point of a vector path.  This would translate to adding an internal "z"
point.  For example below, there are three internal path points for path "a":
M, L and z.

    \path a = (0,0)--(3,4)[z]

Care should be taken when pasting from a path with a "z" point, as this "z"
point will be pasted without modification as well.
For the following example, path "c" would have had a single z path point.

    \path a = (0,0)--(3,4)[z]
    \path c = &a_2

In the example below path "c" would be empty. This is because the position
information of a "z" point does not exist, and thus nothing is added to "c".

    \path a = (0,0)--(3,4)[z]
    \path c = (&a_2)



## The 'lastpt'

The last position of an absolute point or a relative is always remembered, and
it is known as the 'lastpt'. The position information of the 'lastpt' is
critical when figuring out the absolute position of a relative point.

    \path a = (0,1)[h:3][v:4]

Note that the 'lastpt' only contains the location information. It does not
include information such as control points of a Bezier curve.

In addition, 'lastpt' is designed to persist over all invocations of path
constructions, even aross different commands. For instance, when building a path
for 'b', the first point of 'b' is a L point with a position at (4,5) because
the 'lastpt' at the time is remembered to be at (3,4).

    \path a = (0,0)[h:3][v:4]
    \path b = [l:1,1]

It is worth pointing out that the 'lastpt' is updated when an absolute
point or a relative point is encountered. It is not updated when an path point
from anther path is "pasted", or when a path function is invoked. For intance,
in the following example the second point of "c" will not likely be (2,2) as one
would have expected. It is actually (4,5) because when "pasting" the first point
of path "a" at the start of the path construction for path "c" the 'lastpt'
isn't updated, and remains set at (3,4).

    \path a = (0,0)--(1,1)--(3,4)
    \path c = &a_1 [l:1,1]

It is possible to save the current location of the 'lastpt' to a path variable
during a path construction so that it can be retrieved laster. This is done via
invoking the "^pt" directive. The following example would save the positional
information of the second path point to a path named "c".

    \path a = (0,0) [l:3,4] ^pt:c [h:5]

Having the notion of a 'lastpt' also allows us to terminate an existing path segment
and start a new one from where it is left off. For instance, we want to construct
a path with a two path segments: the first from (0,0) to (1,1), and the second one
from (1,1) to (3,3), we can do it the following way:

    \path a = (0,0)--(1,1) ()--(3,3)

The set of open and close parentheses by itself with an asterisk in it signals to 
add an absolute point that is exactly the same position as the current position
of the 'lastpt'. The previous example may seems to be a trivial change and the
visual result might exactly the same as having one larger path segment, but the
previous example allows us to style the second path segment such as to 
draw it using a dashed line.

    \path = (0,0)--(1,1) ^hint:linedashed (*)--(3,3)
  



## Path functions

A path function is similar to a named path, except that its contents are
dynamically generated based on its "arguments". For instance, in the following
example the path function "circle" returns a coords array that describes a
full circle centered at location (2,3) and with a radius of 4.

    \path a = &circle{(2,3),4}

The returned coords array might be "closed" depending on the situation. For instance
the previous "circle" path function would always return a "closed" path, whilst
the "polyline" path function will not.

Each path function would have had different requirements for its arguments. The
arguments for the "circle" path function would have required that the first one
be a path, such as (2,3), and the second one be a scalar, such as 4.  

As a matter of fact, these are the only two argument types for a path function.
For an argument that is of a path type, it would either expect a literal point
notation, such as (2,3), or named path notation, such as ``&o``. For instance,
the same circle path function could be invoked as follows.

    \path o = (2,3)
    \path a = &circle{&o,4}
    \path a = &circle{(2,3),4}

It is also possible to pass an "array" as an argument.
Some path functions such as 'points' would work with array arguments.
An array argument is identified by the appearance of a set of brackets.

    \path a = &points{[1,2,3],[4,5,6]}

Or 
    
    \var xarr[] = [1,2,3]
    \var yarr[] = [4,5,6]
    \path a = &points{[@xarr],[@yarr]}

Internally, a scalar is considered the same type as that of an array and is
stored as an array of a single value.

If an incompatible argument is passed, then a sensitive default value is to be
assumed for that argument. For instance, for a 'circle' path function the first
argument is expected of a path with at least a single point. However, if a wrong
argument is passed or the path does not have any point in it, then a default
point of (0,0) is assume.

Likewise, the second argument of the 'circle' path function is assumed to be
zero if no scalar is specified for that argument.

Note that 'lastpt' is not updated when a path function is encountered.



## The 'hint'

There is an internal variable named 'hint' that holds the last hints
designated by the user. To set this variable, use the "hint:" directive.

- ^hint:linedashed
- ^hint:linedashed|linesize2
- ^hint:linedashed|linesize2|linesize4

Each of these strings is translated into a bit field that is then OR'ed
together. For instance, if we were to construct a path to express the fact that
the line should be drawn at size 2, we could do the following.

    \draw ^hint:linesize2 (0,0)--(0,2) 

Note that the idea behind using a hint is to allow for a path to be constructed
to have multiple independent vector paths and each individual vector could have
its own settings such as line size, and color, etc. For this reason, a hint is
only valid for a vector path that immediately succeeds it, and will be cleared
as soon as this path is terminated. For intance, in the following example the
second and third vector path will not have the same hint as the first.

    \draw ^hint:linesize2 (0,0)--(0,2) \
         (0,2)[l:-0.5,-0.5] \
         (0,2)[l:0.5,-0.5]

Following is a list of hints:

    this.hint_linedashed = 1 << 0;
    this.hint_linesize2  = 1 << 1;
    this.hint_linesize4  = 1 << 2;
    this.hint_nostroke   = 1 << 3;
    this.hint_nofill     = 1 << 4;
    this.hint_lighter    = 1 << 5;
    this.hint_darker     = 1 << 6;
    this.hint_shadow     = 1 << 7;
    this.hint_fill0      = 1 << 8;
    this.hint_fill1      = 1 << 9;
    this.hint_fill2      = 1 << 10;
    this.hint_fill3      = 1 << 11;
    this.hint_fill4      = 1 << 12;
    this.hint_fill5      = 1 << 13;
    this.hint_fill6      = 1 << 14;
    this.hint_fill7      = 1 << 15;
    this.hint_fill8      = 1 << 16;
    this.hint_fill9      = 1 << 17;
    this.hint_stroke1    = 1 << 18;
    this.hint_stroke2    = 1 << 19;
    this.hint_stroke3    = 1 << 20;



## Setting up the 'offset'

During a path construction, each path point is subject to an internal "offset".
The "offset" is nothing but a pair of numbers each expressing an offset in the
horizontal and/or vertical direction.  When one of the numbers is not zero, all
future points of this path will be subject to having this offset be added to
its x and/or y coordinate.  This design allows for the same path to appear
in different locations.

    \draw           (0,0)[h:2][v:2]
    \draw ^x:2 ^y:3 (0,0)[h:2][v:2]

The 'offset' can be set using quite a number of directive. Some of the
direction would set the offset directly, while others allow it to "change"
relative to its current settings.

- ^x:2
- ^y:2
- ^X:2
- ^Y:2
- ^left:2
- ^right:2
- ^up:2
- ^down:2
- ^pt:a
- ^at:a
- ^center
- ^north
- ^south
- ^east
- ^west
- ^northwest
- ^northeast
- ^southwest
- ^southeast
- ^xmax
- ^ymax
- ^node:1
- ^box:1
- ^car:1

The "^x", "^y", "^X" and "^Y" directive would each set the x or y direction directly. 
The lowercase x/y would start from the origin. The uppercase X/Y would start from the other side
of the viewport.

The '^left', '^right', '^up', and '^down' directives is each to shift the offset
in the direction as instructed for a given number of grid distances.  The
value after the colon is expected to be a number that expresses the number of
grid units.  Note also that these operations are accumulative such that
incurring two "up:1" equals a single "up:2". Using of negative numbers is 
also allowed.

The '^pt:a' directive is to save the current offset to a path named 'a'.
The '^at:a' directive is to set the current offset so that it coincides with the first
point of a path named "a". The value after the colon is expected to be the name
of an existing path, such as 'a', or 'a_1' for expressing the second point of
path 'a'. 

The '^center', '^north', '^south', '^east', '^west', '^northwest',
'^northeast', '^southwest', and '^southeast' directives would set the origin
relative to the current size of the viewport.

The '^xmax' sets the x of the current origin to a value that equals to the viewport width.
The '^ymax' sets the y of the current origin to a value that equals to the viewport height.

The '^node:1', '^box:1' and '^car:1' are each used to setup the offset so that
it aligns with the location of a node, a box and/or a Cartesian plane. For the
node and box, only the x/y locations are altered. However, for a Cartesian
plane, both the x/y locations and x/y scalings are alterd.



# Built-in path functions

During a path construction, a path function is used to return an independent
path segments constructed according to some parameters. For example, the
'&rectangle' path function can return a path segment that represents a
rectangle with a given width/height located at certain point.

Note that for a path function all its arguments must be either a path variable,
an absolute point, or a scalar.

- midpoint 

The ``midpoint`` function returns the mid point of the first two
points in a path expression if a single argument is given. Following
returns a path with a single point: (1.5,2), which is the mid point
of (1,1) and (2,3).

```          
\path b = &midpoint{(1,1),(2,3)}
```

Note that only the first two points of a path is used. The other
points are ignored. Thus if path a has three points, then the third
point is simply ignored.

If two arguments are given, it does a linear interpolation alone the
line segment of the first two points, and return a point that
corresponds to the percentage of the path traveled from the first
point to the second. The second argument is an floating point number
between 0-1. For example, if 0.5 is given as the second parameters,
it should return the same path as that with a single argument. Thus,
following example will return the same result as the one before.

```          
\path b = &midpoint{(1,1),(2,3),0.5}
```

- scatterpoints 

The ``scatterpoints`` function is to create new path with the
points distributed evenly beteen the two end points. The 
first and the second argument denotes the first and the last
point of the path. The third argument is a scalar 
expressing how many middle points it needs to create between
the two end points. Thus if it is zero then the path will
be just the starting and ending points. If it is 1 then
the path will be three points, with one point in the middle.
In the following example two middle points will be created
such that the path contains four points.

```
\path a = &scatterpoints{(1,0),(10,0),2}
```

- linelineintersect 

The ``linelineintersect`` Returns new a path that contains a
single point which is the point at which the two lines intersect.
The first line is described by the symbol 'a', which must have at
least two points. The second line is described by the symbol 'b',
which must have at least two points. Only the first two points of
'a' and 'b' are considered. The rest of the points of 'a' and 'b'
are ignored.

```
\path b = &linelineintersect{(0,0),(10,0),(-1,5),(1,5)} 
```


- linecircleintersect 

The ``linecircleintersect`` function returns new a path that
contains two points for the line and circle intersection. In the
following diagram the pts variable 'pts' will hold two points: (6,2)
and (4,2).

```
\path b = &linecircleintersect{(0,0),(10,0),(5,0),10}
```

Note that the returned point is always arranged such that the first
point is on the left hand side of the second point.

- circlecircleintersect 

This method returns one or two points where two circles intersect.

```
\path b = &circlecircleintersect{(0,0),10,(5,0),10}
```

- circlepoints 

The general syntax is: &circlepoints(center,r,a1,a2,a3...), where
the 'center' denotes a path with a point expressing the circle
center, and 'r' for the radius of the circle, and 'a1', 'a2', 'a3',
etc., that expresses the angles starting from the first quadrant.
The returned value is the coords of individual points at these
angles.

```
\path b = &circlepoints{(0,0),2,30,60,90}
```

- pie

Returns a closed path expressing a pie. 

```
\path b = &pie(center,radius,angle,span)
```

- circle 

Returns a path expressing the circle. It has a syntax of:
&circle(center,radius), where 'center' is a path with at least one
point, and 'radius' a scalar.

```
\path b = &circle(center,radius)
```

- ellipse 

This return a path expressing an ellipse. The syntax is following.
The fourth argument is the rotation in degrees, in counterclockwise
rotation.

```
\path b = &ellipse(&center,xradius,yradius)
\path b = &ellipse(&center,xradius,yradius,rotation)
```

- rectangle 

This returns a path expressing a rectangle between to points. There
are three ways construct the triangle, that is shown below. The
first one construct a rectangle between to opposing points. The
second one constructs a rectangle with an anchor point and then the
width and height of it. The third one construct a rectangle with
just the width and height, assuming the anchor point to be at (0,0)

```
\path b = &rectangle{&point1,&point2}
\path b = &rectangle{&point,width,height}
\path b = &rectangle{width,height}
```

- triangle 

This returns a path expressing a triangle of three points. The syntax is: 

```
\path b = &triangle(&point1,&point2,&point3)
```

- equilateraltriangle{(0,0),3}

This returns a equilateral-triangle centered at (0,0) and with a side
measurement equal to 3 grid length.

- regularpentagon{(0,0),3}

This returns a regular pentagon centered at (0,0) and with a side measurement
equal to 3 grid length.

- asatriangle{&Left,B,a,C}

This returns a triangle ABC when two angles and the side between the two
angles are known.  The triangle is oriented such that the known side is layed
horizontally with its left end point being at the point given by the 'Left'
argument. The second argument expresses the angle of the triangle located at
the left end point of the side, and the forth argument expresses the angle at
the endpoint on the right hand side.  The third argument is the length of the
side between the two angles.

- polyline 

This returns a path expressing a polyline. The syntax is:

```
\path b = &polyline{&point1,&point2,&point3,...}
```

- polygon  

This returns a path expressing a polygon. The syntax is:

```
\path b = &polygon{&point1,&point2,&point3,...}
```

- cylinder 

This expresses a upright cylinder drawn with an ellipse at the
bottom, with xradius/yradius, and a given height. The syntax is:

```
\path b = &cylinder{&center,xradius,yradius,height}
```

- ymirror 

This returns a new path that is a mirror image of a given path. The
first argument is the old path, and the second argument is a scalar
that is a value on X-axis. The following example returns a new path
that is a mirrored image of 'a' off the x-axis.

```
\path a = ...
\path b = &ymirror{&a,0}
```

- mirror 

This returns a new path that holds a single point that is the mirror
image of the given point along a given line. In the following example
the returned point 'a1' would have been set to (-5,0)

```
\path a = (5,0)
\path b = (0,0)
\path c = (0,10)
\path a1 = &mirror{&a,&b,&c}
```

- bbox 

This returns a new path that represents the rectangle of the
viewport.

- grid

This returns a new path that represents a grid. It expects four 
arguments, the first two of which is the width and height of the grid,
and the last two represents the steps in the x-direction and y-direction.
The following example would have drawn a grid of 10-by-10, with grid
line separation of 1 in both directions.

```
\path a = &grid{10,10,1,1}
```

- rotatepoint

This function would first rotate the point around a given point and then adjust
the new point alone the line between itself and the center such that its
distance from the center is exactly the given length.  The following example
would rotate the point (1,0) around a center that is (0,0) for 90 degrees
counter-clockwise angle and the finally adjust itself such that its
distance from the center is exactly 2.

```
\path a = &droppoint{(0,0),(1,0),90,2}
```

- droppoint

The second form would have had three points, and the returned value
is a point on the line segment that is the first two points. The following
example is to return the point that is (0.5,0)

```
\path a = &perpoint{(0,0),(2,0),(0.5,1)}
```

- rotate{&A,90}

This rotates a given path by a certain angle in an anti-clockwise rotation.

- translate{&A,10,20}

This translates a given path by a given distance in X and Y direction.

- bisect{&A,&B,&C,r}

This will compute a new point that lines on the line that is the result 
of bisecting the angle ABC, and with a distance of 'r' away
from vertex 'B'.

- points{[@a],[@b]}

This will return a new coords array where each coords point is a 'M' point
composed of corresponding points in array 'a' and 'b'. 

- lines{[@a],[@b]}

This will return a new coords array in the same manner as that of the 'points'
function, except that each coords point is a 'L' point except for the first one
which is a 'M' point.



# Built-in path names

Following are built-in path that are readily available.

+ north

  This would have returned a point that coincides with the top side of the
  viewport and which centers horizontally.

+ south

  This would have returned a point that coincides with the bottom side of the
  viewport and which centers horizontally.

+ east

  This would have returned a point that coincides with the right hand side of the
  viewport and which centers vertically.

+ west

  This would have returned a point that coincides with the left hand side of the
  viewport and which centers vertically.

+ northwest

  This would have returned a point that coincides with the top left hand corner
  of the viewport.

+ northeast

  This would have returned a point that coincides with the top right hand corner
  of the viewport.

+ southwest

  This would have returned a point that coincides with the bottom left hand corner
  of the viewport.

+ southeast

  This would have returned a point that coincides with the bottom right hand corner
  of the viewport.

+ center

  This would have returned a point that coincides with the center of the
  viewport.




# Drawing arrow head

If a coordinates is to be used directly then there are three commands that will
draw a arrow, reverse arrow, and double arrow for each path segments.

    \arrow     (0,0)--(3,4)  (2,2)[h:4]
    \revarrow  (0,0)--(3,4)  (2,2)[h:4]
    \dblarrow  (0,0)--(3,4)  (2,2)[h:4]

However, for other operations such as 'drawanglearc', then
the 'arrowhead' should be set for the style, which is an integer
that is follows:

    \arrowhead:1   arrow
    \arrowhead:2   reverse arrow
    \arrowhead:3   double arrow

# Remarks and problems

- The arrow head in HTML is done using MARKER-element. And for SVG 1.1 the
  limitation is that its coloring and filling is not changed to the line
  element it attaches to. It is a browser problem and currently there is no
  fix.

- For SVG a choice will have to be made. For a plain text a text-element is
  used and or for math text a nested SVG-element is to be constructed in the
  same way an inline-math is.  Unfortunately, there is no easily to allow for a
  text to be drawn so that part of it is plain text and part of it is math,
  because doing so would have required that we know exactly how many pixels the
  plain text would have taken, even though do know how many piexls a piece of
  math text is.  There is no way to correctly position the part of math text
  relative to the surrounding plain text if the length of the plain text isn't
  known.

- The text-aligmnents are default to 'urt' and not 'centered', thus we need to
  ensure previous auto choices of text alignment which asssumes the center are
  now being shown as 'urt' and thus we need to make some adjustments where
  necessary.

- Note that for a LATEX document with MetaPost commands, a single backslash by
  itself that is not followed by another backslash can cause the compilation of
  pdflatex to fail, even when that single backslash exists only in a comment.
  The same kind of behavior has also been observed in a TEX file as well.  Thus,
  care must be taken to ensure that this does not happen, basically to ensure
  that a single backslash is always escaped by another.



# Scalar and scalar expression

A "scalar expression" is an expression that evaluates to a number.  

    \var a = (2+2)*(3+3)
    \var a = cos(3+0.1415) + 12
    \var a = 3 + pow(3,2)*3 + 2
    \var a = 3 + E + 2
    \var a = 3 + PI + 2
    \var a = sign(-5)
    \var a = 2*PI
    \var a = 2*2e5
    \var a = deg2rad(180)
    \var a = 1/0
    \var a = ln(0)

The scalar expression is expected by a command such as 'var'. It is also
expected inside a dollar-expression such as 

    \drawtext "${x*2}" (0,0)

The scalar expression has a syntax very much like those supported by the 'expr'
command of a modern day Tcl interpreter. It recognizes the plus, minus,
multiplication and division operators. The multiplication operator is the
asterisk, and the division operator is the slash character.

It provides a list of built-in functions such as 'ln' and 'sqrt'. It also
recognizes user defined functions which are created by a previous "fn" command.  It
supports operator precedence of multiplication and division over addition and
subtraction, and recognizes parentheses for grouping. It also recognizes a
number that is in the form of a scientific notation such as '2e5' or '2e-5'.

Following are examples of using an expression to assign a number to
a environment variable 'a'. Note that 'E' and 'PI' are two built-in constants
where the first one is the Euler's number and the second one being the
ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.

Following is likely what to be observed in the outputs of a translation.

    % <-- var a = (2+2)*(3+3) -->
    % <-- *** env a = 24.000000 -->
    % <-- var a = cos(3+0.1415) + 12 -->
    % <-- *** env a = 11.000000 -->
    % <-- var a = 3 + pow(3,2)*3 + 2 -->
    % <-- *** env a = 32.000000 -->
    % <-- var a = 3 + E + 2 -->
    % <-- *** env a = 7.718282 -->
    % <-- var a = 3 + PI + 2 -->
    % <-- *** env a = 8.141593 -->
    % <-- var a = sign(-5) -->
    % <-- *** env a = -1.000000 -->
    % <-- var a = 2*PI -->
    % <-- *** env a = 6.283185 -->
    % <-- var a = 2*2e5 -->
    % <-- *** env a = 400000.000000 -->
    % <-- var a = deg2rad(180) -->
    % <-- *** env a = 3.141593 -->
    % <-- var a = 1/0 -->
    % <-- *** env a = Infinity -->
    % <-- var a = ln(0) -->
    % <-- *** env a = Infinity -->
    % <-- show ${a} -->
    % <-- show Infinity -->
    % <-- *** show Infinity -->

Note that if a scalar expression returns something that cannot be interpreted
as a valid number, "Infinity" or "NaN" might be observed.

It is also possible for a scalar expression to contain a variable that
refers to a x/y component of a path point. In the following example
the variable 'mx' will be assigned the sum of adding the "x"
components of the first two points in path variable 'pts', which will
be "1 + 3 = 4".

    \path a = (1,2)--(3,4)
    \var x = &a_0.x + &a_1.x
    \var y = &a_0.y + &a_1.y
    \show ${x}
    \show ${y}

The dollor-expressin is designed to turn any expression into a string. For instance
the expression of ``${x}`` would have replaced itself with the actual value of the
variable ``x``. If ``x`` does not exist as a valid variable, "NaN" is returned. 

    \var x = 1
    \show ${x}

This would have been equivalent to the following single command
  
    \show 1

This is because by default, the precision is set to 6, which means any numerical
value will automatically be shown as a floating-point number with 6 digits of
decimal places. This precision can be changed by setting the "precision" option.

    \var x = 1
    \show ${x}

The previous commands would be equivalent to the following single command:

    \show 1

However, as a special exception, if the variable is by itself and it
is recognized to be a string,
then it is shown verbatim.

    \var x = @"Hello world"
    \show ${@x}

This would have been equivalent to the following command

    \show Hello world



# The complex number

The quantity within a 'var' and 'array' command is a complex number,
which consists of the 'real' and 'imaginary' components. In many situations
only the 'real' component is to be recognized and the 'imaginary' component
ignored. However, the real and imaginary component can also be extracted 
by the syntax of '$a.re' and '$a.im', assuming that 'a' is a variable
holding a complex number.

Following is an example that would draw a dot at the location of (1,2).

    \var a = 1 + 2i
    \drawdot ($a.re,$a.im)


# Array of scalars

A list of scalars is also an expression that denotes a list of scalars, 
instead of a single one. This expression is enabled whenever a list
of scalars is expected, such as after the equal sign of a 'var' command
when the variable is preceeded by an at-sign, in which case the variable
is expected as an array that is to hold a list of numbers instead
of holding a single one.

    \var a[] = 0 1 2 (1+2) 

The same expression could be found elsewhere where a list of scalar is expected,
such as a "for" loop command:

    \for i in 0 1 2 (1+2); \do
      ...
    \done

If the array is to be represented by an existing array variable, then the previous
command can be written as:

    \for i in [@a]; \do
      ...
    \done

The set of rules for denoting a list of scalars is different than that used for
denoting a single scalar. The main difference is that, by default, each scalar
is to be understood to be separated from its neighboring scalars by one of more
white spaces. In the previous example, a list of four scalars are recognized,
and last one is also recognized as an expression and will be processed as such.

In addition, following four syntaxes are recognized.

- Properties
- Texts
- List-expression 
- A fn-directive

A list-expression is recognized by the presence of a set of brackets
around an item.

The list-range-form is another form. It comes with two flavors, the one with two
colons, and the one with three colons. The only difference between the two is
that the first one assumes a step of 1, and the second one is computed
dynamically based on the distance of the first one and the second one. For
instance, following example would have generated a list of numbers that are 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.

    \var a[] = [1:10]

The following would have generated a list composed numbers that are 1, 4, 7, 10.

    \var a[] = [1:4:10]

Note that in the case of the having three columns the middle number serves as the 
second number after the first one, and additional numbers are generated with the same
difference between the second and the first, and with the last number not exceeding
the third one. 

However, if the middle number is surrounded by a beginning and ending exclamation mark, then
this number is interpreted as expressing how many intermediate points are 
to existing between the two end points which is the first and last number.
The following example would have produced a total of 22
points, with the first point being 0, and the last point being 10, and
additional 20 points generated between 0 and 10 such that the distance between
any two neighboring points is the same.

    \var a[] = [0:!20!:10]

Another list-expression is to populate a list from an existing array, known as
list-array-form. Following expression would pull the content of an existing aray
named 'c' and a list is built off the content of this array, plus two additional
items that is 4 and 5.

    \var c[] = 1 2 3
    \var a[] = [@c] 4 5

If a list-expression does not fit the definitions of the previous three
categories, then it would be treated as a list-comma-form. This form would look
for comma separated items. Spaces between commas are optional.

    \var a[] = [1, 2, 3, 4]

Note that the spaces after each comma is optional. 

It should be pointed out that all the previous list forms can be mixed in another
order, and the result of which is simply the concatenation of all list items 
from these individual lists.

    \var c[] = 10 11 12
    \var a[] = 1 2 3 [4:10]
    \var a[] = [1:2] [3:4] 5 6 7 [8:10]
    \var a[] = [1,2,3,4] [5,6,7,8] 9 10 [@c]

Note that a list is automatically recognized and populated in a 'for' command
as well.

    \var a[] = 1 2 3
    \for i in [@a]; \do
      \show ${i}
    \done

Following is another way of iterating the same list.

    \for i in 1 2 3; \do
      \show ${i}
    \done

Or,

    \for i in [1,2,3]; \do
      \show ${i}
    \done

Or,

    \for i in [1:3]; \do
      \show ${i}
    \done

An entire array can be show by the dollar-expression as well. Ensure that the
array variable is to appear by itself, and proceeded by '@'.

    \var a[] = 1 2 3
    \show ${@a}

A directive is also to be recognized. A directive adds extra possibility to the
list of numbers. For the moment only the "fn" directive is supported. This
directive allows for a function to be called such that the output of this
function replaces the original scalar.

    \var a[] = ^fn:sqrt 1 2 3 4 5 6
    \show ${@a}

Following would be the output of these commands:

    % <-- var a[] = ^fn:sqrt 1 2 3 -->
    % <-- *** env @a = 1 1.4142135623730951 1.7320508075688772 -->
    % <-- show ${@a} -->
    % <-- *** show 1 1.4142135623730951 1.7320508075688772 -->

If two "fn" directives are encountered, the last "fn" is called first, and the output 
of which becomes the input to the first "fn". 

    \fn add2(x) = x+2
    \var a[] = ^fn:add2 ^fn:sqrt 1 2 3
    \show ${@a}

In the previous example each scalar is to go
through the "sqrt" function first before being sent to the "add2" function.

    % <-- fn add2(x) = x+2 -->
    % <-- *** fn add2(x) = x+2 -->
    % <-- var a[] = ^fn:add2 ^fn:sqrt 1 2 3 -->
    % <-- *** env @a = 3 3.414213562373095 3.732050807568877 -->
    % <-- show ${@a} -->
    % <-- *** show 3 3.414213562373095 3.732050807568877 -->

It is also possible to refer to an array element. To do that simply use the variable
followed by an underscore itself.

    \var a[] = 1 2 3
    \var b[] = a_1 a_2

Following would be the result of the translation.

    % <-- var a[] = 1 2 3 -->
    % <-- *** env @a = 1 2 3 -->
    % <-- var b[] = a_1 a_2 -->
    % <-- *** env @b = 2 3 -->

# Built-in scalar constants

Following are built-in scalar constants, which can be used as if they
are arguments. For instance, 

    \var arc = 2*PI
    \var mynum = 1 + 2*I

This the 'arc' env-variable would have been assigned the value of 6.28.

# The 'origin' command

The 'origin' command sets the following parameters for the current
drawing environment.

- \origin ^up:2
- \origin ^down:2
- \origin ^left:2
- \origin ^right:2
- \origin ^x:2
- \origin ^y:2
- \origin ^sx:2.5
- \origin ^sy:2.5
- \origin ^s:2.5
- \origin ^at:a
- \origin ^pt:a
- \origin ^reset
- \origin ^center
- \origin ^north
- \origin ^south
- \origin ^east
- \origin ^west
- \origin ^northwest
- \origin ^southwest
- \origin ^northeast
- \origin ^southeast
- \origin ^xmax
- \origin ^ymax

If it starts with "left:<x>", "right:<x>", "up:<y>", 
"down:<y>", where the distance expresses the number of grid units
to move in that direction. 

If it starts with "x:", then it expresses the distance from the left hand side
of the viewport. 

If it starts with "y:", then it expresses the distance from the bottom side
of the viewport.

If it is "sx:2.5" then it sets the scaling factor in the horizontal direction 
to be 2.5. 

If it is "sy:2.5" then it sets the scaling factor in the vertical direction 
to be 2.5. 

If it is "s:2.5" then it sets the scaling factor in the horizontal and
vertical direction to be 2.5. 

If it is "at:a" then the 'origin' will be set to a point coincides with the first
point of that path.

If it is "at:a_0" then the 'origin' will be set to a point coincides with the first
point of that path.

If it is "at:a_1" then the 'origin' will be set to a point coincides with the second
point of that path.

If it is "at:a_2" then the 'origin' will be set to a point coincides with the third
point of that path.

If it is "at:a_3" then the 'origin' will be set to a point coincides with the forth
point of that path.

If it is "pt:a" then it creates a new path variable named 'a' such that it
contains a single point that coincides with the current settings of the
new origin.  If this path variable already exists it will be overwritten.

If it starts with "reset" then the current origin will be set to (0,0) and the 
scaling factors will be reset to 1 in both horizontal and vertical directions.

If it starts with 'center', 'north', 'south', 'northwest', 'northeast', 'southwest', 
'southeast', 'east' and 'west', then it sets the origin to the center,  the four  
corners of the viewport, or the middle of the four sides of it.

If it starts with 'ymax' the origin is moved so that its y-position is at a
position same as the viewport height. If it starts with 'xmax' the origin
is moved so that its x-position is at a position same as the viewport width.


# The 'group' command

The "group" operation is to create a new group that holds a collection
of attribute values such that they will be applied to an element
all at once. This allows, for instance, creating of many different
boxes all of the same attributes. Changes made to a group affects all
elements inheriting attributes from that group.

    \group mygroup {linesize:1,w:3,h:2}
    \box {group:mygroup} (0,0) (1,2) 
    \box {group:mygroup,linesize:2} (0,0) (1,2) 

In the previous example the first box will be created with "linesize:1", "w:3",
and "h:2" attributes. The second box will have the same set of attributes as
the first one except that it will have "linesize:2" instead of "linesize:1".




# The 'path' command

The 'path' command can be used to create path variables. A path
variable must start with a upper case or lower case letters, and
followed by one or more upper case or lower case letters, or digits.
Symbols and operators are not allowed.

    \path a = (1,1) -- (2,2) -- (3,4)

The name of a path must conform a valid symbol name, which must start with an
upper case or lower case letters, and followed by one or more letters and/or
digits. Note underscore or other punctuations are allowd. Followig are valid
path names:

    a
    ab
    a0
    ab0
    ab00
    ab00ab00

The path command also has provision to allow for something akin to
JavaScript "array destructuring" statement, in which case individual
points of a path are assigned to different path variables at the same
time by the same assignment instruction. In the following assignment
instruction path variables 'a', 'b' and 'c' are each created and
assigned three different points of the same path that was drawn by the
``draw`` statement.

    \path A = (1,1) -- (2,2) -- (3,4) -- (4,5)
    \path a/b/c = &A

Each sub-variable must be separated from other sub-variables by one or
more slash character. You can skip ahead and bypass certain points by
not including any variables in between slashes. For example, you can
choose to assign the first point to variable 'a' and the third point
to variable 'b' as follows.

    \path A = (1,1) -- (2,2) -- (3,4) -- (4,5)
    \path a//b = &A

Following example will skip the first two points and assign
the remaining two points to variable 'a'.

    \path A = (1,1) -- (2,2) -- (3,4) -- (4,5)
    \path //a = &A

Note that the name of the path, as well as that of a scalar variable, a scalar
array, or a scalar function, must starts with a letter, followed by one or more
letters of digits. Names such as 'a', 'b', 'a0', 'b0', 'aa0', 'a0a', 'a0a0' are
all valid names. Names such as '0', '1', '0a', '0b', '00ab', etc., are not valid
names.

Aside from the path-destructuring syntax, such that each path symbol will be given
just one of the points, there is also a path-desequencing, such that only one of the 
symbols in the list will be picked to receive the entire path expression.
This syntax is typically used in conjunction with a 'for' loop command.
In the following example, the path 'A' will receive "(1,1)[h:2]",
and path 'B' will receive "(3,3)[h:2]", and path 'C' will receive "(5,5)[h:2]".

    \for i in [1, 3, 5]; \do
      \path @[A,B,C] = (i,i) [h:2]
    \done

This is done internally by looking up the current value of '@' scalar, which is
internally maintained by Diagram and is always assigned an integer indicative
of the iteration. If this scalar is 0, then the first symbol is selected. If
the scalar is 1, the second scalar is selected. So on and so forth.  All symbol
names listed must conform to the restriction of being a valid symbol name.  If
the list runs out, then no symbol name is assumed.



# The draw/fill/stroke commands    

Following commands treats the input argument as path.

- \draw
- \fill
- \stroke
- \arrow
- \revarrow
- \dblarrow

The 'draw' command would draw connecting lines between path points.
Typically it is straight lines, but Bezier curves are also supported.
This includes quadratic and cubic curves. The SVG arc is also
supported.

    \draw (0,0)--(1,1)--(2,2)

The 'fill' command is similar to 'draw', except that it fills the path
with the default filled color, without drawing the the outline of the
path (without stroking it).

The double-hyphen operator between points indicates that it should be
a straight line between two points. However, it is assumed if two
points are detected without a connecting double-hyphen between, such
as the case of the second and third point above. The points are
typically expressed as absolute points, but relative points can also
be expressed. They are all in the form of [...] where a set of
brackets are present.

    \draw (0,0) [l:1,1] [l:1,1]

Here the second and third points are each expressed as a distance away from its
previous point, which is to move right for one grid unit and then up for one
unit. Note that the coordinates in Diagram are always expressed in terms of
grid unit. There are other relative position syntaxes, that are shown below.

Note that for all 'draw' related commands, a path can be expressed such that it
contains multiple disjoint segments. For example, we can express to draw two
disjoint line in a single 'draw' command such that the first line segment goes
from (0,0) to (2,3) and the second line segment goes from (4,5) to (6,7). 

    \draw (0,0)--(2,3) (4,5)--(6,7)

For example, for the following 'draw' command, where
there is a closed triangle and a line. 

    \draw (0,0)--(2,0)--(2,2)[z] (4,0)--(6,2)

For MetaPost output, each path segment requires a separate "draw" command. For
SVG, a single PATH elements is sufficient; the SVG is implemented such that a
"M" operation can follow a "z". 

By default, the 'draw' command would stroke the path. However, if a path
segment is closed (when ended by a "cycle" keyword), then then it would also
attempt to fill the area. However, the 'fill' command will attempt to fill the
area regardless if it is closed or not. On the other hand, the 'stroke' command
will stroke the path, such that if the path is closed, a line will appear
between the last point and the first one.

For SVG, when a 'fill=' attribute is specified the rendering engine will
attempt to fill the area, even when the area is not closed. For
MetaPost/MetaFun the path will have to be closed before calling the 'fill'
MetaPost, as otherwise the compilation will complain.





# The 'drawcongbar' operation

This operation is to draw a short bar to indicate the congrudencies
of two or more line segments. It will look for all line segments
in the coords and will draw a short bar (can be changed via vartype
style) in the middle of the line. In the following example a short
bar is to be drawn in the middle of the horizontal line and in the middle
of the vertical line.

    \drawcongbar (0,0) [h:4] [v:4]

The length of the short bar is determined by the barlength-option,
The bartype-option will also be checked
to see if it has been set. It can be set to 'double' to indicate a double bar, 
or 'triple' to indicate a triple bar. The gap between the bar lines are determined
by the gap-option, which defaults to 0.1 unit length.


# The 'drawanglearc' command

The 'drawanglearc' command is to draw an arc or half square showing
the angle formed by two consecutive line segments of a polyline
encountered in the given path. The angles formed is assumed to start
from the first point to the third point, where the second point acts
as the vertex of the angle, and this will continue for the rest of the
path, picking any two consecutive line segments, and skipping those
that are not. If the path is closed, the line segment pairs between the last
line segment and the first is also checked. 

If the 'inversed' style option is set to 1, then the angle formed is
assumed to run from the third point to the first.

This command will also be able to drawn angle label. If the path is
closed then the angle between the last point and the first point is
also to be drawn. If any of the angle is found to be exact 90 degrees,
a square is to be drawn instead of the arc.

    \drawanglearc "1" "2" (2,0)--(0,0)--(0,2)

If the angle is found to be around 90, then a square is drawn instead
of an arc. However, a square can be forced if ".sq" option is given.

    \drawanglearc.sq "1" "2" (2,0)--(0,0)--(0,2)


# The 'drawcenteredtext' command

The 'drawcenteredtext' command is to draw a piece of text
in the center of every line segment found in the path.
In the following example the text "1", "2" and "3" are placed
in the middle of three sides of the triangle shape.

    \path tri = &triangle{(0,0),(4,0),(2,2)}
    \stroke &tri
    \drawcenteredtext "1" "2" "3" &tri

Any connecting line segments are located, including those that are not
necessarily straight lines, such as Bezier curves and arcs. For these,
it is treated as if it is a line segment and the text will be drawn in
the middle of that line segment. If the path is closed, then there would
be assumed a line segment between the last point and the first point.

If without option, it is assumed that the text will be drawn centered
in the middle of that line segment. However, the command option such as
"lft", "rt", "urt", "ulft", "llft", "lrt", "top" and "bot" can also
be specified so that the text is shifted. In addition, the tx-style
and ty-style can also be used to specify additional adjustment of text, 
as well as the shift-style would also influence the position of the 
text.



# The 'drawslopedtext' command

The 'drawslopedtext' command is to draw a sloped text centered along a line
segment.  The command scans for the presence of all line
segments in the coodinates provided, and for every line segment found,
place a label that run along the slope of the line.

    \drawslopedtext "Hello" "World" (0,0) [h:4] [v:4]

By default, the text will be placed at the center of the line, following the
slope of the slide.  However, this position can be changed by adding the option
to the end of the command.  For instance, the ".bot" option would have asked that
the text be placed at the bottom of the line.

    \drawslopedtext.bot "Hello" "World" (0,0) [h:4] [v:4]

Note that the text will still be following the slope of the line. The same
option can be replaced by others such as ".top", ".lft", ".rt", etc..

The mar-style if specified would ask that two arrows be added at either end of
the text to connect to the two end points of the line segment.  The style
option is an integer expressing the length of each arrow in grid units.

The pen-style would have asked that two vertical lines be added at the two end points
of the line segment. Each vertical line is perpendicular to the slope of the line segment.
The style option value expresses the lengh of line in each direction.

    \drawslopedtext "\(\sqrt{2}\)" {mar:1,pen:0.25} (0,0)--(5,5)



# The 'drawdot' command

The 'drawdot' command is to draw a dot to mark the location. Similar to
the primitive command, a single dot is to be repeated for all points
on the given path. Thus, following command will draw three dots each
at three different locations of the input path.

    \drawdot (1,1) (3,4) [l:2,1]

The 'drawdot' command provide several subcommands that allows for a
different shape to be drawn instead of a circular dot.

    \drawdot.hbar (1,1) (3,4) [l:2,1]
    \drawdot.vbar (1,1) (3,4) [l:2,1]

For 'drawdot' command, the color can be specified using the 'dotcolor'.

    \drawdot {dotcolor:orange} (1,1) (3,4) [l:2,1]

For 'hbar' and 'vbar' subcommands the 'linecolor' attribute would have
expressed the color of the lines.

    \drawdot.hbar {linecolor:orange} (1,1) (3,4) [l:2,1]
    \drawdot.vbar {linecolor:orange} (1,1) (3,4) [l:2,1]

The diameter of the dot can be set using the 'dotsize' attribute.

    \drawdot {dotcolor:orange, dotsize:10} (1,1) (3,4) [l:2,1]

For 'hbar' and 'vbar' subcommands the 'linesize' attribute would hve
expressed the width of the line.

    \drawdot.hbar {barcolor:orange, linesize:2} (1,1) (3,4) [l:2,1]
    \drawdot.vbar {barcolor:orange, linesize:2} (1,1) (3,4) [l:2,1]

The 'dotsize' and 'linesize' are both expressed in terms of 'pt'. For
'hbar' and 'vbar' commands, the length of the bar can be specified via
the 'barlength' attribute. It is a number that expresses the line
length in grid unit. If not specified, the default value is 0.25,
which is one-quarter the length of a grid, and it can be changed to a
different value by the 'set barlength' command.

    \drawdot.hbar {linecolor:orange, barlength:0.5} (1,1) (3,4) [l:2,1]
    \drawdot.vbar {linecolor:orange, barlength:0.5} (1,1) (3,4) [l:2,1]

Here, the length of each bar is going to be about half the length of
the grid. Note that for 'vbar', it's lower end point aligns with the
location, and for 'hbar', its left end aligns with the location.


# The 'drawtext' command

The 'drawtext' command is designed to place a piece of text in one or more path
points. For instance, each of the following 'drawtext' commands will place a piece
of text at the given location.

    \drawtext.rt "A" (1,1)
    \drawtext.lft "B" (2,2)
    \drawtext.top "C" (3,4)

The text must appear before any path points, and must enclosed within a set of
quotation marks. 

The text to be drawn is always to be shown in a single line. It will
be shown in the first path point encountered. However, if additional
path points are specified, then the same text is to be repeated 
across the other path points.

    \drawtext "A" (1,1) (2,2) (3,4)

The option of this command specifies how the text is aligned relative
to the path point. For instance, if the option is 'top' then the 
text will be aligned in such a way that it appear on top of the 
path point and centered horizontally. Without the option,
it defaults to 'urt'.

-   \drawtext.top   -  top
-   \drawtext.bot   -  bottom
-   \drawtext.lft   -  left
-   \drawtext.rt    -  right
-   \drawtext.ulft  -  upper left
-   \drawtext.llft  -  lower left
-   \drawtext.urt   -  upper right
-   \drawtext.lrt   -  lower right
-   \drawtext.ctr   -  centering the text

It is also possible to express the fact that each path point is to show a
different piece of text, by placing double backslashes inside the text, such
that the text is being divided into segments, where each segment represents an
individual text to be placed at the location of one of the path points, 
and in the same order. For instance, the following command would have placed
letter "A" with the first point, letter "B" with the second point, and letter "C"
with the third point.

    \drawtext "A" "B" "C" (1,1) (2,2) (3,4)

It is also possible to express that a math expression instead of plain text.
by setting the "math" style flag to 1.
In the following example the first and the last text labels are 
treated as math text while the middle one is treated as plain text.

    \drawtext {math:1} "A_0" "A_2" (1,1) (3.4)

The text command also allows for each entry to be laid out such that it is
multi-line paragraph. Note that this only works for plain text, and not
for math.

    \drawtext.ulft {fontsize:7} "degree\\3" (-3,2)
    \drawtext.urt  {fontsize:7} "degree\\2" (3,2)
    \drawtext.llft {fontsize:7} "degree\\2" (-3,-2)
    \drawtext.lrt  {fontsize:7} "degree\\3" (3,-2)

In addition, the 'drawtext' command has the capability to style the font using
the "fontfamily" and "fontstyle" style options. Note that this might not 
always work for something. For instance, for LATEX and CONTEX it is not
possible for specifying both a monospace and an italic.

    \drawtext.ulft {fontfamily:monospace,fontstyle:italic,fontsize:7} \
          "degree\\3" (-3,2)



# The 'drawlabel' command

The 'drawlabel' command would have been the same as for the 'drawtext' except
that it does not support drawing multiple line text as that was the case for
the 'drawtext' command. In addition, the technical approach might be different
for that used by the 'drawtext' command, and the exact differences varies
depending on the translation. Following discusses some of the differences
observed in some translation:

- For MF, when 'drawlabel' is called, it uses the 'label.urt' command to draw
  the text, while when 'drawtext' is called, it first calls 'textext', which
  will generate a picture, holding the entire drawing of the text, and then
  "paste" this picture onto the main picture relative to anchor point based on
  the alignment. The problem of using 'drawtext' has been seen that there isn't
  any gaps between the anchor point and the start of text, while using
  'drawlabel' ensure a reasonable amount of gap to exist. There is also a
  problem of using the 'drawtext' approach when drawing individual digits and
  period, and the period has been seen to not align with the bottom of the digit
  vertically.

- For TikZ there isn't any difference.

- For SVG when 'drawlabel' is used an extra 2 pixel is added horizontally
  between the anchor point and the start of the text. For 'drawtext' there isn't
  this space, thus the text is right on top of the point.






# The 'car' command

The car-command would setup and draw a Cartesian coordinate frame, with optional
axes, grid lines/numbers, and others.
Following are like cases where this command is involed,

- car.1 (5,5)
- car.1 {xgrid:0.5, ygrid:2}
- car.1 {xgrid:0.5, ygrid:2, xaxis:-5 5 1, yaxis:-5 5 1}
- car.1 {xgrid:0.5, ygrid:2, xaxis:-5 5 1, yaxis:-5 5 1, xtick:-4 -3 -2 -1 1 2 3, ytick:-4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4}

This command is typically be supplied by a command option, which expresses the
ID(s) of the Cartesian coordinate system. Each path point of the command line
expresses the location where the origin of the Cartesian coordinate frame is to
be located within the viewport.  For instance, the first example above
expresses that the origin of the first Cartesian coordinate frame be located at
(5,5).

Additional style option can be added.  For instance, the xgrid-style and
ygrid-style asks that the coordinates in the x-axis and/or y-axis direction be
scaled. For instance, the "xgrid:0.5" would have meant that a viewport grid of 1 be
translated to a x-axis distance of 0.5 for this Cartesian frame, effectively 
having scaled the coordinate by 2.

The xaxis-style controls the appearance of the x-axis of the frame.  This
option expects two or three numbers. The first two numbers express the
minimum/maximum the axis would have to cover. For instance, an "xaxis:-5 5"
would have meant for an x-axis to be drawn that covers the x-coordinates from
-5 to 5. These numbers are in the unit of the Cartesian grid unit. Similarly,
"yaxis:-5 5" would have means for a y-axis to be drawn to cover a range of -5
to 5. Note that the actual length of the x-axis or y-axis also depends on 
the current settings of the xgrid-style and ygrid-style.

The third argument to the xaxis-style and yaxis style is a number that
expresses whether an arrowhead is to appear. It is 0 if no arrowhead is to
appear, 1 if arrowhead is to appear at the positive end, and 2 if arrowhead is
to appear at the negative end, or 3 if arrowhead is to appear at both ends.

The xtick-style and ytick-style options controls the appearances of the ticks
on x/y-axis.  The option value is a list of numbers for the ticks.

After a Cartesian frame is created, it can be used to convert a point on this frame
back to the point on the viewport. In the following example we are drawing
a dot at the location that corresponds to the point of (4,3) within the cartesian
frame.

    \drawdot (#car:1,4,3)

Similarly, we can draw line segment can be drawn between Cartesian point (4,3) and (5,10)
using the following command.

    \draw (#car:1,4.3)--(#car:1,5,10)

In addition, there is a "^car" path directive such that when set, would have
setup for the future path points to be constructed relative to this new origin
and with scaling factors congruent to each of the scaling factors of the
Coordiante frame. For instance we can draw the previous two points using the
following 'draw' command and the result will be exactly the same.

    \draw ^car:1 (4,3)--(5,10)



# The 'if' command

The 'if' command is used to conditionally execute some block of codes
depending on the condition of an Boolean expression, such as 'i > 10',
'i == 10', 'i >= 10', 'i < 10', 'i <= 10', and 'i != 10', etc.

    \if i > 10; \then
      show ${i}
    \elif i > 5; \then
      show ${i}
    \elif i > 0; \then
      show ${i}
    \else
      show ${i}
    \fi

Note that the Boolean expression must be ended by a semicolon. The 'elif' and
'else' components are optional, and can be omitted. The body statements with
each branch should carry an indent so that it does not interfere with the
process of 'elif', 'else' and 'fi' lines. The 'fi' line would terminate this
command.

A compound Boolean statement is possible, in which case each individual
Boolean statement is to be joint by the keyword "AND" and/or "OR".

    \if i > 10; AND j == 10; \then
      \show ${i} ${j} 
    \fi

    \if i > 10; OR j == 10; \then
      \show ${i} ${j} 
    \fi

Note that each individual Boolean expression should still end with a semicolon
regardless if it is to be joint by another Boolean expression down the road.

There isn't a limit when it comes to how many Boolean expressions can be
joint by AND/OR.

    \if i > 10; AND j == 10; OR k != 5; \then
      \show ${i} ${j} ${k}
    \fi

It should be pointed out that all logical operators are treated equally. This
means that they will not be internally regrouped based on the preferences of
one operator over the others, which might have been the cases for some other
programming languages.

If an invalid logical operator is specified, then Boolean expression simply
overrides the one before it. For instance, the following 'if' command considers
the expression true only if variable 'j' is set to 10, completely ignoring the
state of variable 'i', because of the fact that there isn't a join thus the
second expression always overrides the first.

    \if i > 10; j == 10; \then
      \show ${i} ${j}
    \fi



# The 'for' Command

A 'for' command is provided by Diagram such that a number of commands
can be repetitively executed, and each iteration these commands would
have been run under a different set of arguments. The basic syntax is

    \for a in 1 2 3; \do
      \draw (a,a)--(0,0)
    \done

Following would have produced the same result as the one above.

    \for a in [1,2,3]; \do
      \draw (a,a)--(0,0)
    \done

In eacho of the previous two examples, the 'draw' command would all have been
executed three times, and can be considered equivalent to the following:     

    \draw (1,1)--(0,0)
    \draw (2,2)--(0,0)
    \draw (3,3)--(0,0)

The 'for' command starts with the keyword 'for', followed by a one or more
pairing of a "loop variable" to a range of floats.  Each pairing must be
terminated by a semicolon, and additional pairs are allowed.  The last part of
the 'for' command must be the word "do".

The 'for' command is designed to repeat the execution of its "loop body", which
consists of a list of command up until but not including the line of the
"\done" command.

The exact number of repetitions depends on the longest of the lists.  If there
are two or more lists to iterate over, and each list has a different length,
the repetition is always to cover the longest list, and the variable that have
run out of list items during certain iterations are simply left unchanges in
which case each of them should have retained its last value.
Following is an example of iterating over two loop variables: 'a' and 'b'.

    \for a in [1,3,5]; b in [2,4]; \do
      \draw (${a},${a})--(${b},${b})
    \done

This should have been equilvalent to the following:

    \draw (1,1)--(2,2)
    \draw (3,3)--(4,4)
    \draw (5,5)--(4,4)

Each loop variable is to become an environment variable, which can be accessed
via a dollar-expression, or be used in other places where an environment
variable is expected.

Note that it is recommanded that the lines of the loop body be indented
with at least one space. This allows for "nested" for-command to work.

    \for a in [9,19,29]; b in [0.4,0.5,0.6]; \do
      \origin ^x:${a}
      \for c in [16,4]; \do
        ...
      \done
    \done
      
In addition, each invocation of a 'for' command would have created an implicit
environment variable named '_'. This variable is to be assigned an integer
congruent to the current iteration: of the first iteration it is assigned the
integer of 0, and the second iteration that of 1, and so on. Note that if an
innner for-command is encountered, the same environment variable will be
overwritten and will restart at 0.

So far, the loop variable is always to be expected to be followed by the
"in" keyword and then the list itself. The list is a list of numbers
separated by spaces, or a range such as ``[1:10]``, ``[1!10!20]``, or
``[1,2,3,4]``. See "array" command.



# The "fn" command

The "fn" command serves to create a user defined arithmetic function.
This command starts with letter "fn", followed immediately by a valid
function names, an equal sign, and an arithmetic expression.

In the following example a function named 'f' is being defined with a
single argument and an expression that evaluates an arithmetic
expression with 'x' as its argument. After this command, referencing
this function with an argument such as "f(4)" inside any other
arithmetic expression is equivalent to evaluating an expression that
is "1 + log2(4)". In the following example, variable 'a' is being
assigned a value of 3 at the end of that command.

    \fn f(x) = 1 + log2(x)
    \var a = f(4)

A function created by a "fn" command can be thought of as a user-defined
function, as opposed to other built-in function such as 'sqrt', 'sign', 'sin',
'floor', 'ceil', 'pow', etc. It can be used in places such as a directive in
an array expression.

    \fn f(x) = 1 + log2(x)
    \var v[] = ^fn:f 1 2 3 4 



# The 'node' and 'edge' commands

The 'node' and 'edge' commands are designed for drawings nodes and edges, two
common components in graph theories.  In particular, each ``node`` command is
to draw a circle, with optional text in the middle.

    \node.A "A" (1,1)
    \node.B "B" (5,5)

The previous two commands would have drawn two nodes, one named "A", and one
named "B" at two locations where each aligns with the center of one of the
nodes. Each node is to have a text placed in the middle.

The default radius for the circle is 1, but it can be configured via the
r-style.

    \node.A {r:0.8} "A" (1,1)

The "edge" command draws edges between nodes. In order to do that, the ID(s) of
the nodes must be specified, and be referenced by the "edge" command.  In the
following example the ``edge`` command is to draw an edge between nodes "A" and
"B".

    \edge.A.B

The edge is by default a straight line. Each end point of this line
starts from the outside of the node, touching the perimeter of the
circle. However, if a curved line is desired, then the "abr" option
can be specified. This option describes an angle in degree, from the
view point of the starting node, how far off it is to veer away from
the straight line direction to reach the destination node. A positive
"abr" option would mean that it makes a counter-clockwise rotation for
that number of degrees, and a negative "abr" expresses that it should
make a clockwise rotation. Note that for the starting node if it is to
make a counterclockwise rotation then the destination node is to have
a clockwise rotation such that the incoming line is to have the same
abbration. The resulting quardratic Bezier curve is to be formed such
that the control point of the Bezier curve is the intersection point
where the two lines meet.

When the starting and ending node is the same, then the 'edge' command
is to draw a loop. This loop is shown in the shape of a cubic Bezier
curve. There are three configuration parameters that is to control the
appearance of this cubic Bezier curve: 'abr', 'protrude' and 'span'.
The 'protrude' parameter determines the distance of the two control
points of the Bezier curve away from the surface of the node; it is an
integer expressing the number of unit length and the default value is
'1'. The 'span' parameter expresses the number of degrees of a central
angle formed by the two control points and the origin of the node. The
'abr' expresses the direction of the middle line bisecting the central
angle; if 'abr' is set to zero and 'span' is set to '30' then the
central angle is -15 to 15; if 'abr' is set to '90' and 'span' is set
to '30' then the central angle is from 90-15 to 90+15. The default
value for 'span' 45. The wider this angle is, the fatter the loop will
appear to be.

Thus, the following example would have drawn a curved edge that is to
come out of the first node at the top of the circle, and then entering
the second node on its left-hand side. This is because the straight
line direction would be a 45 degree from the first node to the second
node, and a negative 45 degree abbration expresses that it should start
out with an angle that is 45 degrees turned to the left hand side 
of the normal trajectory, placing the starting direction at a due north 
direction. 

    \node.A  (1,1)
    \node.B  (5,5)
    \edge.A.B {abr:-45}

A positive "abr" option would have expressed that it should veer away 
towards the right hand side of the normal trajectory.
If the edge is going to include arrow heads, then the 'arrowhead' style option
should've been provided.

    \edge.A.B {arrowhead:1,abr:45}
    \edge.A.B {arrowhead:2,abr:45}
    \edge.A.B {arrowhead:3,abr:45}

In order to be connected with lines, each node should have an ID assigned to
it. If a node is to be created inside a for-loop this
operation could proven to be difficult to manage, as the name was hard
coded for each loop. Fortunately, the 'node' command allows for a flexibility
when it comes to choosing an id for it. In particular, you can use the
at-expression for expressing a list of Id where only one of them will be chosen.
The chosen Id will be one of those in the list and its location depends on the
current iterations of the loop, such that the first iteration will chose
the first one, and the second iteration the second one, and so on.

    \origin ^center
    \for theta in [0:60:359]; \do
      \var r = 2
      \var x = cos(deg2rad(theta)) * r
      \var y = sin(deg2rad(theta)) * r
      \node.@[1,2,3] {r:0.5} (x,y)
    \done
    \node.0.1.2 {fillcolor:red}

For an 'edge' command, the 'shift' style option can be utilized to allow for
a label to be shifted slightly away from its centered position so that
the text label does not obscure the edge line. By default the text label 
is drawn centered and the location is the middle of the edge.

The 'shift' option expresses a quantity that is interpreted as expressing
a length in unit distance. A negative value should have shifted the label
to the left hand side of the edge, and a positive value would have shifted
it to the right.

When the edge is a loop, which is the case when the two vertices are
the same, then the shift-option expresses an additional centrifugal
distance from the center of the node.

Aside from being a circle, a node can also have two additional shapes,
namely RREC and RECT, which is controlled by the "nodetype" member
of the config. 

    \node {nodetype:RREC} (0,0)
    \node {nodetype:RECT} (5,5)

The first one would have created a rounded square, and the second a 
plain square. The width and height of the square is 2 times the 'r'. 

Instead of drawing a connecting line between two nodes, where the end point
of that line is will be calculated so that it lands on the border of that
node, it is also possible to specify an anchor point of a node, so that 
it can be used inside a "draw" or "stroke" command or other commands
as a path point. The valid names of a node are the following:

    o1
    o2
    o3
    o4
    o5
    o6
    o7
    o8
    o9
    o10
    o11
    o12

Each anchor point corresponds to the hour label of a clock, such as "o3" would be
the anchor that is due east, and "o9" an anchor point at due west. This makes it 
possible to draw a line from (0,0) to the "o9" anchor point of node 1 
as is shown by the following example.

    \node.1 (5,5)
    \draw (0,0) -- (#node:1:o9)




# The 'box' command

This command is to draw a box at the location expressed by each path points.
The size of the box is to be controlled by the 'w' and 'h' members of style
options. If absent, the 'w' is assumed to be 3 and 'h' 2.
  
    \box {w:3, h:2} (0,0) (1,2)  
    
It is also possible to place a label inside a box. 

    \box {w:3, h:2} "hello\\world" "Goodbye" (0,0) (1,2) 
    
The "boxtype" style holds the type of boxes to be drawn,
other than the default rectangular shape.  Note that
regardless the choice of the boxtype, the geometry of the
shape will always be confined to the width and height given
by "w" and "h".

    \box {boxtype:RECT} "Hello\\World" (0,0)

A box can come with an ID string, which must consists of all
word characters. If it is provided, then the ID string is
saved internally with the geometry of the box, and can later
be retrieved to redraw the same box with maybe a different
color, line size, and/or text.  In the following example the
box is first created with the given type and string, and 
placed in the location specified. However, it is later
redrawn with a different text because the location and
the type of the box has already been saved with the given
id "1".

    \box.1 {boxtype:RECT} "Hello\\World" (0,0)
    \box.1 "Goodbye" 

The previous example would have had two text being drawn on 
top of each other. This might not be a desirable effect, but
if a "fillcolor" is provided then previous text would have
been erased first.

    \box.1 {boxtype:RECT} "Hello\\World" (0,0)
    \box.1 {fillcolor:brown} "Goodbye" 

If the id of the box is underscore, it will be assigned an Id in the same
mannor as that of the 'node' command. 

Unlike the "node" command, the location of a box is always the lower-left
hand corner of the box, where the 'w' and 'h' member of the config 
controls the width and height of the box stemming from that point. On the other hand,
the location of a "node" is always its center, and the 'r' member of the config
controls the radius of the node, which would be the half width and half height
of the node if that node has been configured as a type of RREC or RECT. 

Note that a box cannot be connected via an 'edge' command. 
However, if a path is to go through
an anchor point of a box, such a point can be specified using
the object-expression such as the following.

    \box.1 "Hello\\World" (0,0)
    \box.2 "Goodbye" (5,5)
    \draw (#box:1:e)--(#box:2:w)

This would have drawn a straight line from the "e" anchor point of box 1
to the "w" anchor point of box 2. The anchor points of a box is follows:

+ e
  The "east" of a box
+ w
  The "west" of a box
+ n
  The "north" of a box
+ s
  THe "south" of a box
+ sw
  The "southwest" of a box
+ se 
  The "southeast" of a box
+ nw
  The "northwest" of a box
" ne
  The "northeast" of a box

Note that an object-expression allows additional arguments that provides
"offset" to the anchor point. This allows the anchor point to be "fine-tuned"
to a slightly different location other than the default one provided.

    \box.1 "Hello\\World" (0,0)
    \box.2 "Goodbye" (5,5)
    \draw (#box:1:e,0,0.1)--(#box:2:w,0,-0.1)

In the previous example, the "e" anchor point of box 1 will be moved up
for 0.1 grid unit, and the "w" anchor point of box 2 will be moved down
for 0.1 grid unit. If for some reason the anchor point is missing, such as
the following, then the lower-left point of the box is assumed.

    \box.1 "Hello\\World" (0,0)
    \box.2 "Goodbye" (5,5)
    \draw (#box:1,0,0.1)--(#box:2,0,-0.1)


# The 'prodofprimesws' command

This command is to show a sheet that demonstrates the progression
of obtaining all prime factors of a given number. 

    \prodofprimesws "12 2 2 3" (5,5)

Note that the result is to show the original product with a list of primes
that are to the left of that number. At this time all prime factors need to be
given as part of the input. For instance, the number "12" above is the product,
followed by 2, 2, and 3 which is the three prime factors of this product. 

In the future it might be desirable for it to automatically figure out the 
prime factor by itself.


# The 'multiws' command

The multiws-operation allows for a multiplication worksheet
to be shown on the canvas. In the following example the workflow
of a multiplication worksheet of 24 multiplied by 3 is to be
shown at location (2,1).

    \multiws "24 3" {answer} (2,1) 

By default "answer" is not set, in which case only
the multiplier and the multiplicant are shown. However, when
the "answer" option is set, the entire worksheet workflow that
leads to the solution is to be shown inside the canvas. 
The "answercolor" can be set which will be used to draw all lines, 
dots, and texts with that color.

    \multiws "24 3" {answer,answercolor:orange} (2,1) 

It is also possible to include a decimal number with one of the numbers
or both numbers. If this the case, the correct decimal place
will be shown both at multiplier and multiplicant
and as well as at the product.

    \multiws {answer,answercolor:orange} "2.1 4" (0,0)
    \multiws {answer,answercolor:orange} "2.1 1.4" (0,0)



# The 'longdivws' command

The longdivws-operation allows one to show the complete workflow  
of a long division between two integers, with quotient and remainders.
In the following example a long division workflow is to be shown 
starting at the coordinate (2,1).

    \longdivws "11 4" {answer} (2,1)

By default the "answer" is not set, in which case only the
the dividend and divisor is to be shown. The "answercolor" can
also be set which will be used to drawn everything that is 
related to the answer, including lines and text.

    \longdivws "11 4" {answer,answercolor:orange} (2,1)

Unlike the "multiws" operation, the "longdivws" operation does
not scan the input for any appearances of decimal points---thus if
a decimal point was included in one of the numbers it 
will likely cause unpredictable result.



# The 'lego' command

The lego-operation allows for drawing of placing Lego-like
objects on top of each other in a three-dimensional space.

    ```diagram{viewport:8 8}
    \config fillcolor white
    \config linesize 1.5
    \config linejoin round
    \lego.size.4.4.4
    \lego.add.z.0 
    \lego.add.z.1
    \lego.add.z.2 
    \lego.add.z.3
    \lego.del.xyz.0.0.2 
    \lego.del.yz.0.3 
    \lego.del.xyz.1.1.3 
    \lego.del.xyz.2.1.3 
    \lego.del.xyz.2.2.3 
    \lego.show (0,0)
    ```

The lego-show operation would place the lego set at the location.

The lego-size operation would set the size of the stacking.
It expectes three integers, each representing the number of
maximum Lego pieces in these directions: x, y and z.  The
x-direction is the horizontal, the y-direction is the depth,
and the z-direction is the height.

The Lego pieces are first added and deleted, and then the
lego-show operation is called to draw all the pieces in the
Diagram.

The lego-add-z operation would add a layer of pieces in the
z coordinate specified.  The lego-delete.xyz operation would
delete a specific piece with the given x/y/z coordinate.

The lego-show and lego-show2 operations are the two
operations that will trigger all commands to be written to
the output. The lego-show is to show the lego pieces in a
perspective view where x-axis is going to the left and down,
y-axis is going to the right horizontally, and z-axis up
straight. 

The lego-show2 is to show the lego pieces where x-axis is
going down and left, y-axis is going right and right, and
z-axis is going straight up. 

Each lego-show and lego-show2 carries its own set of
skew factors for the pieces, which can be set by the 
'skew' option. Following shows the default set of arguments
for each operation.

    \lego.show {skew:0.36 0.30 1.00 0.90}
    \lego.show2 {skew:0.80 0.45 0.70}

For lego.show operation, the first two arguments are the
skewed values in x-direction and y-direction. The third and
fouth arguments are the width and height of front facing 
rectangle.

For lego.show2 operation, the first and second arguments are 
the half width and half height of the diamond of the top
face. The third argument is the height.

Either lego.show and lego.show2 operation would have
generated Lego pieces that are shaded differently for two 
of its faces for each piece. For lego-show the front facing
face is shaded lighter, and the face facing to the right 
is shaded darker. For lego-show2 operation the face facing
upward is shaded lighter and the face facing right is shaded
darker. 




# The 'drawcontrolpoints' Command

This command would look for for presence of 'C' and 'Q' Bezier curves in the 
path, and then draw the control points as well as the two end points of this
curve on the chart. The control points will be drawn using round dots, and
end points of the Bezier curves as square dots.



# The 'var' command

The 'var' command is to create an environment variable that
is the result of an arithmetic expression, a text string,
or an array.  Following is an example of a arithmetic expression.

    \var a = pow(2,1/12)
    \draw (0,0)--(a,a)

Following is a example of creating a variable that holds an array.

    \var o[] = 1 2 3
    \for i in [@o]; \do
      \drawdot (i,i)
    \done

Following is a example of a text string composition.

    \var s = @"%d-%d-%d" 301 444 5591
    \drawtext "${@a}" (0,0)

The first example has created an environment variable named 'a', 
that is assigned a numerical value that is equivalent to 
evaluating the arithmetic function "pow(2,1/12)".  The result of
an arithmetic expression is always a number, thus a number is stored
internally with the symbol 'a'.

The same symbol, once defined and assigned a number, can later be used in other
arithmetic expression such as the following example which 'a' is used
to compute a value that is 2 multiples of 'a' and the value of which
is assigned to variable 'b'.

    \var b = a * 2;

Note that the number is complex-number-ready, which means the number 
is internally represented as a complex number. This allows the following
expression to be constructed that would express a complex number that is "2+3i":

    \var c = 2 + 3i

Note that the spaces around the plus-sign is optional. In fact the entire
expression is just treated as a regular math operation of addition, with 
the first number "2" treated as a number for a real component, and the 
second number treated as a number for the imaginary component. It does it
by noticing the 'i' or 'j' after a normal number, such as "2", "3", "2.123", etc.
If it has found that a 'i' or 'j' is following such a number, then it treates
the entire number as expressing the imaginary component and performs the math
accordingly. 

In addition to using 'i' or 'j', the math constant "I" can also be used.
This is the same constant as other constants such as "PI" and "E", where the
only difference is that "I" represents the unit of the imaginary component,
and "PI" and "E" are fixed numbers only having a real component for itself.
Thus, the following expression would have assigned the complex number "3i" 
to variable 'd'.

    \var d = 3 * I

Note that it is illegal to use a "i" or "j" by itself, such as the following
which is illegal.

    \var d = 3 + i

This is because a letter within an expression by itself is to be treated as a
variable. Thus, the previous expression would have looked for a variable named
"i", and by failing to find it, would have caused the entire expression to
become NaN.

When the expression after the equal sign starts with a at-sign, or '@', then
the expression is assumed to return a string rather than a number.  There are
two different situation in which a string can be formed. The first is that the
at-sign is followed by a set of quotation marks, such as the following, in
which case anything within the quation string is treated as a "template", such
that it will be scanned for the appearances of "formattng groups", which is
replaced by something that appears after it.  The following example would have
created a variable named "s" that holds a string that is "301-444-5591".

    \var s = @"%d-%d-%d" 301 444 5591

In the second situation is when the at-sign is followed by a variable, 
in which case the value of that variable is pulled and its value is treated
as a string. For instance, after the previous example has created the variable named 's',
we can create another variable 's1' that hold the same value of 's'

    var s = @s

This allows us to construct a string an later used inside a command that expects
such.

    \var s = @"%d-%d-%d" 301 444 5591
    \drawtext "${@s}" (0,0)

The 'var' command is also able to create an "array" variable, in which
case the variable is to hold a list of numbers, rather than a single number. 
To reference this variable as an array, it must appear inside set of square
brackets and prefixed by an at-sign. For instance, the following example
has first created and assigned the variable 'a' an array that consists of 
three items, and then reference this array by the name of 'a' inside a 
for-command.

    \var a[] = 1 2 3
    \for i in [@a]; \do
      \drawdot (i,i)
    \done

An array variable can also be referenced by its individual elements. The syntax
is to start with the variable, followed by a underscore, and then one or more digits
to express the position within the variable. For instance, "a_0" would have been
recognized as a variable that references the first element of an array named "a",
and "a_1" would have referenced the second element of array named "a".
The following example has created an array of three numbers, and was later
on used to generate text output on various locations, pulling the content of 
each element of the array. 

    \drawtext "${a_0}" "${a_1}" "${a_2}" (0,0) [h:1] [h:1]

Following are formatting groups that are recognized.

+ %%

  This formatting group is to output the percent-sign itself
  It does not consume any argument.

  ```
  \var a = 1.23456789
  \var s = @"%0.2f%%" a
  % s => '1.23%'
  ```

+ %_

  This formatting group is to output an integer that is current setting
  of '_'. This variable is typically set by the for-loop to an integer
  that is indicative of the current iteration. It does not consume any 
  argument.

  ```
  \for i in [11,23,56]; \do
    \var s = @"%_" 
  \done
  % s => '0'
  % s => '1'
  % s => '2'
  ```

+ %f

  This formatting group is to treat each arguments as a floating point
  number. The number after the period inside the formatting group
  express the decimal places to be used for this number.

  ```
  \var a = 1.23456789
  \var s = @"%.2f" a
  % s => '1.23'
  ```

+ %d 

  This formatting group would parse the argument as an integer.

  ```
  \var a = 0x10
  \var s = @"%d" a
  % s => "16"
  ```

+ %x 

  This formatting group is to output a hexdecimal number of the 
  given quantity. The lower-case ``x`` would've generated a hex
  number with all letters between A-Z in lowercases, where
  the upper-case ``X`` letter would've generated a hex
  number with all letters between A-Z in uppercases.

  ```
  \var a = 15
  \var s = @"%x" a
  % s => "f"
  \var s = @"%X" a
  % s => "F"
  ```

+ %X

  See formatting group ``x``.

+ %b

  This formatting group is to output a binary number with one's and zero's.

  ```
  \var a = 5
  \var s = @"%b" 5
  % s => "101"
  ```

+ %o 

  This formatting group is to output an octal number.

  ```
  \var a = 0xF0
  \var s = @"%o" a
  % a => "360"
  ```

+ %c

  This formatting group is to turn an integer to a Unicode character
  with that given code point.

  ```
  \var a = 65
  \var s = @"%c" a
  % a => "A"
  ```

+ %s

  This formatting group is to treat the argument as a string.

  ```
  \var a = 1.23
  \var s = @"%s" 
  % s => "1.23"
  ```

Note that if a variable holds a string, and it appears inside an arithmetic expression,
then the result would be undefined if the string cannot be recognized as a legal number.
For instance, in the following example variable 'c' is holding a string that is "Hello",
and when later it is used to perform an addition, the result becomes NaN.

    \var c = @"Hello"
    \var d = c + 10
    % d = NaN

  

# The 'trump' command

The 'trump' command is designed to show faces of a playing card. It
has provision to show a card from 1-9, 'A', 'J', 'Q', and 'K', from
any one of the four suits.

To show a card of diamond-10 at coordinates (5,5), type the following
command.

    \trump.diamond.10 (5,5)

For a standard card, the size is fixed at 5 grid unit in width and 6
grid distance in height. For the previous command, the lower-bottom
location of the card will be aligned with the coordinates (5,5). The
font-size for any texts inside the card is fixed and is not
configurable. The face of the card will always be filled with the
color of white and is not configurable. The only visual changes that a
user can provide is the width of the outline of the card.

The second part of the command is the name for the suit. It should be
one of the following names:
 
     diamond
     heart
     club
     spade

The third part of the command is the letter for the individual card.
It should be a integer between 1-10, or a capital letter that
is either 'A', 'J', 'Q', or 'K'.

For diamond and heart the color red will be shown for all interior
symbols. For club and spade, color black will be used. These options
are currently not configurable.

However, if a different card size is desired, the width and height of
the new card can be configured by setting the 'scaleX' and 'scaleY'
configuration parameter. For instance, setting 'scaleX:0.5' and
'scaleY:0.5' would have effective shrink the size of the card to 2.5
grid distance in width, and 3 grid distance in height, or half of what
it normally is. Note that the 'rotate' parameter will not have any
effect on this command.  



# Copy-and-paste Buffers

Copy-and-paste Buffers are internal buffers to Diagram. It saves
buffers allowing a collection of lines in one instance of a Diagram invocation
to be copied and later "pasted" into a location of another Diagram invocation. 

Here, the term "buffer" is simply defined to be a collection of lines
between to instances of comment lines. 

When a comment line is detected inside a Diagram, the text after the percent-sign
is scanned, and see if it fits one of the following two patterns:

1. If the text befits the pattern of "(=word)" where "word" is a
   placeholder for a string of one or more word characters, then lines
   between this comment and the first occurence of the next comment
   will be saved to a buffer, and the name of the buffer will be the
   actual string denoted by "word".

2. If the text befits the pattern of "(?word)" where "word" is a
   placeholder reresenting any length of string having one or more
   word characters, then it represents a desire to retrieve the
   contents of a previous saved buffer for which its contents are to
   be inserted into the current location of the source program. The
   name of the named buffer is the string expressed by the "word".

Note that for a copy-buffer, the copied lines are included for as long 
as it does not conform the form of a percent sign followed by an equal,
then optional question mark, and then zero or more word characters only
or nothing else.

Following example would have created a copy buffer named "a" and
within it insert three lines.

    %?a
    \draw (0,0)--(4,4)
    \draw (0,0)--(5,5)
    \draw (0,0)--(6,6)
    %

Following is an example of inserting these three lines at the beginning,
such that the diagram will have four "draw" commands total.

    %=a
    draw (0,0)--(7,7)

Following is an example of repeating the same block of commands inside
another Diagram. The first Diagram has defined three buffers,
assigning them names that are 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The second Diagram
simply just asks that the program codes saved in buffer 'a' be pasted
into the program at that location. The third and fourth Diagram does
the same thing except for asking for a different buffer to be
retrieved.

    ```diagram
    %?a
    \trump.diamond.J {scaleX:0.5,scaleY:0.5} 2  1
    \trump.heart.Q   {scaleX:0.5,scaleY:0.5} 7  1
    \trump.spade.K   {scaleX:0.5,scaleY:0.5} 12 1
    \trump.club.A    {scaleX:0.5,scaleY:0.5} 17 1
    %
    %?b
    \trump.diamond.10 {scaleX:0.5,scaleY:0.5} 2  5
    \trump.heart.9    {scaleX:0.5,scaleY:0.5} 7  5
    \trump.spade.8    {scaleX:0.5,scaleY:0.5} 12 5
    \trump.club.7     {scaleX:0.5,scaleY:0.5} 17 5
    %
    %?c
    \trump.diamond.6  {scaleX:0.5,scaleY:0.5} 2  9
    \trump.heart.5    {scaleX:0.5,scaleY:0.5} 6  9
    \trump.spade.4    {scaleX:0.5,scaleY:0.5} 10 9
    \trump.club.3     {scaleX:0.5,scaleY:0.5} 14 9
    \trump.club.2     {scaleX:0.5,scaleY:0.5} 18 9
    %
    ```

    ```diagram
    %=a
    ```

    ```diagram
    %=b
    ```

    ```diagram
    %=c
    ```

Note that it is specifically designed such that the copied lines will NOT
include any line that is a "paste" command.  In the following example only the
first "draw" command is copied to buffer "a".  The presence of the paste
of "b" buffer interrupted the copy buffer.

    %?a
    \draw (0,0)--(4,4)
    %=b
    \draw (0,0)--(5,5)
    \draw (0,0)--(6,6)
    %

In the example below the first "draw" command is copied to 
the "a" buffer and the last two "draw" commands to the "b" buffer.

    %?a
    \draw (0,0)--(4,4)
    %?b
    \draw (0,0)--(5,5)
    \draw (0,0)--(6,6)
    %


# Fill-out data

It is possible to also add text above the hrule done by the 
\hrule command. This feature is possible to allow for creating
a figure with only the hrule, followed by another diagram with
the same hrule but with added text on top of it.

It is done by supplying each \hrule with an option that serves
as the ID for this hrule, such as 

    \hrule[A]{5}

Which will draw a line of 5em long by default. However, if an option
named "A" is set, either by the style option or by 'config' command,
then the text of it should be treated as a math text that would
be parsed and the result of which stacked on top this hrule. Following
is an example where the first diagram draws four hrules each of which
were given an ID of A, B, C, and D. The second diagram would have loaded
the same source, but in its style supplying the option of A, B, C and D
each of which is a string of math text. Thus, when the second diagram
is drawn it would have seen the math text associated with the ID of 
each of the four hrule, and will then pull the math text from the style
and the use it to place it on the top of the hrule.
    
    ```diagram{width:100%,save:ex3,viewport:22 12}

# Show external PNG image

An external PNG file could be shown from within a Diagram. 

    \image "image-clock.png"

The current implementation would always show the external image centered at the
viewport, with the image enlarged or shrinked necessary to cover the entire
viewport, while maintaining its original aspect ratio.
    
The path points and config parameters are not needed for the 'image' command and
are silently ignored if they are present. The name of the image file must appear
as the text part of the argument.

If more than one images are expressed, then only one of the images will be chosen,
and the algorithm as to which one is chosen depends on the specific platform. For instance,
for HTML/EPUB translation a SVG file will be preferred over a PNG or PDF, and for LATEX/CONTEX
a PDF file would be preferred over a PNG or SVG.

    \image "image-clock.png" "image-clock.svg" "image-clock.pdf"



# Generate multiple frames

It is possible to generate multiple frames from with a single DIA block. To 
for force an output immediately, use the \output command:

    \output

This command would have generated an output with the contents of all
previously executed commands. The \clear command can be used optionally
to purge all internally generated commands such that the next \output 
would have only contained outputs from recent action commands.

    \clear

By default, if at the end of a DIA bundle there is no output frame being generated,
then at least one frame will be generated that would have contained all outputs
at that moment.




# Specialized draw command

Following are specialized draw commands that would draw shapes.

- \drawline = this would draw a single line between any two neighboring
  coordinate points, it takes the first two coordinate points to draw the single
  line, the next two points to draw the second line, and so on.
- \drawpolygon = this would draw a closed polygon with all the of the
  coordinates.
- \drawrect = this would draw a single rectangle for each coordinate points, the
  width and height of each rectangle is to come from the "w" and "h" property of
  the style.
- \drawcircle = this will draw a circle for each coordinate points, the radius
  of each circle is to come from the "r" style property
- \drawpie = this will draw a circular pie for each coordinate points, the
  radius comes from the "r" style, the start angle comes from "start", the span
  comes from "span".
- \drawsector = this will draw a circular sector for each coordinate points, the
  inner radius comes from the "inner" style, the outer radius comes from "outer"
  style, the start angle comes from "start", the span comes from "span".
- \drawellipse = this will draw an ellipse for each coordinate points, which is
  to be the center of the ellipse, the "rx" and "ry" are going to come from the
  style attributes.
- \drawqbezier = draw quadratic bezier curve, it requires at least three points
- \drawbezier = draw cubic bezier curve, it requires at least four points



# Translations

For LATEX translation, each DIA is placed inside a "tabular" as a single
table data in a single table row where the data is style by a letter that is "l".
This "tabular" is then placed inside a "threeparttable"; this setup is to allow
for a subcaption to be at the bottom of that "tabular", which is to become
an integral part of the "threeparttable" itself. The benefit of using a "threeparttable" is that
if two "threeparttable" are placed side by side, then the "baseline" between them 
is the line between the top "tabular" and the bottom "subcaption", such that 
they if one table is to have a multi-line subcaption and the other is a single-line,
they still line up nicely.

The frame is done by inserting a "\hline" at the top and bottom of a "tabular",
and also setup so that the left and right part of the table both has a vertical line.

However, one of the anomaly is that there is a visible vertical gap between
the bottom of the picture and the bottom border of the "tabular".
