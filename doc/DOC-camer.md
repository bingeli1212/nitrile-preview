---

The Camer backend is designed to typeset a CONTEX document that resembles a
report, an article, or other type of technical document. 

This document is designed to typeset document in a single column. For a
multi-column document, use the Camerile backend.


# CJK Language Support


The Camer backend has a built-in support for CJK characters, including Hiragana
and Katakata. Characters of these natures are automatically recognized and
assigned the font name according to one of the following scripts.

- cn: For Chinese characters (simplifed)
- tw: For Chinese characters (traditional)
- jp: For Japanese Kanji, Hiragana, and Katakana
- kr: For Korean Characters

The font names listed above are generated by default in the preamble section of
the exported document, such that the font names are immediately avilable. A
pre-defined list of fonts are selected and associated with the font name. These
fonts are selected based on their availability with the last TexLive
distribution of 2021. There is currently no provision to switch to a different
font for any of the four scripts
