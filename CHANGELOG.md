## 0.1.0 - First Release
* Every feature added
* Every bug fixed

- 6/25/2019

- Allow figures to be generated for LATEX

- Preview of figures and images are done using a placeholder frame
  (rendered using SVG) showing the image file name, and the subcaption
  of this image.

- Added support for %!BOOK block, in which case it is used to generate a
  LATEX document with 'book' as its document class. Generating this
  document requires the '%!BOOK' block, and within which specifies
  individual chapters which must come from other source files.

- Added support for cross reference markup [^/src1.md] for referring to
  the label of the highest heading of the source file 'src1.md'.

-  6/26/2019

- Allow for opening of source files from within preview of %!BOOK block

- Changed cross reference markup syntax to [^/d3js] or [^/d3js:intro]
  or [^/:intro]

Nitrile

- [ ] Allow configure the width of figure/table/listing to something other than the full page width.
- [x] Figure out how to do "gather" or "gather*". One way to do it is to check the alignment of the first equation. Thus, the Tokenizer.toMathSvg() should also return another flag in addition to "shiftdist" such as "aligned", in which case it is set to 1 when a & is detected. It can also return 2 or more if more & is detected.
- [x] Try to implement using double-backslash \\ for splitting an existing equation into multiple lines, and they should be \begin{equation}\begin{split}...\end{split}\end{equation}. The LATEX will ensure that it is right-aligned if no & is found, and aligned to the & if there are. This would also solve the problem of only assign a single equation number for each $-block. 
- [x] Implement \sfrac{1}{2} which is the command provided by "xfrac" package.
- [x] to fix the \begin{align} ... \end{align} 
- [x] Reimplement do_verb using \begin{tabbing} so that it can be in two column mode
- [x] Place all stacked equations into a larger SVG
- [x] Use G-element for shrinking the inner SVG.
- [x] For wide-listing, use a custom-float in wide mode, and to add a new config-option that will split a long listing into multiple individual floats, each with a 1/2, 2/2, etc as part of its caption text
- [x] Eliminate the ILST and expand the DLST to include **|* so that the first one is used UL and second for DL. Also change it so that it recognizes various components, such as ${..}, {..}, {{..}}, ``..``, `..`, etc. It should also be smart so that for LATEX if the key-component is a math, which cannot be placed inside an \item, then it should use a UL.
- [x] Need to find a way to optionally include libertine because if the user has used a different document class such as Koma-series then there is no need to include libertine
- [x] The do_frmd for LATEX does not work after font is changed
- [x] Consider merging neighboring PLST blocks, and allow no vertical margins between consecutive list items.
- [x] For HTML, rather than hard code font size, use a <span> and define a class name for it, so that stylesheet can define its size. Instead of using font-family, we should use <tt> instead. 
- [ ] Allow EPUB creation to specify a different CSS stylesheet that is not connected directly with the source document. Maybe a switch or something
- [x] Add a class type FSCAP for all fig caption text
- [x] Use { ... } syntax for specifying options for all Diagram-API, for label.* command see if the text can be set else as a separate option before this command is invoked
- [x] circle.fill and circle.area
- [x] Change the longtable designator back to (&). Should use a convension parentheses as multiple paragraph 
- [x] The do_csvd is currently broken on all THREE
- [ ] Need to change do_csvd to rows instead of cols.
- [x] circle.fill, circle.draw, circle.area 
- [x] circle {start:90;stop:120}  The original order is [radius, angle1, and angle2]
- [x] Need to change drawanglearc operation
- [x] Add more fonts that cover the Unicode U+2717 "BALLOT X"
- [ ] Implement a binary that would return 1 to a Unicode font code point that is current covered by the internal fontmap.
- [x] Make sure to add class='xxx' to all blocks not just the selected few
- [x] Change CSVD to TABU
- [x] See if we can use \startparagraph for typesetting TABB block in CONTEX
- [x] For processing a standalone document that has its "root" pointing to another document, then the current document should appear as a chapter, or section or that 
- [ ] implement the ruby items as a JS Map object and check for duplicates
- [x] Add a way to insert an image in its native size.
- [x] Change the cartesian.a command so that the text and justi comes from its own style options rather than from the global 'label' and 'justi' options
- [x] Fix all Diagrams that are broken in Math*.md file after the last changes in Diagram
- [x] Compass and StraightEdge does not work and shows up as black blocks in math-bisecting.md, this shows up for both LATEX and COnTEX
- [ ] Use the <!-- --> for row1 and row2 in HTML, such that when a MD file is only to remove some white spaces this would have shown up as the only thing that is changed
- [x] Find a quick way to generate an inilne image that is the result of a Diagram: so far the available ones are \xyplot{} and \vbarchart{}
- [ ] Standardize the cartesian.setup and barchart.setup so that they all just represent origin and width, and use other command to set the other attributes, such as cartesian.xrange, cartesian.yrange, etc
- [x] Redefine PICT block format so that it consists only a n-by-m grid, rather than
- [x] Get rid of labelgapx/labelgapy, and setup new options such as dx: dy: to set the additional space for label
- [x] Add \( .. \) and \[ ... \] 
- [x] Rename all cartesian.text.* to cartesian.label.* command
- [x] Separate translation engine from parser
- [x] change so that the third argument to cartesian.xplot/yplot is to indicate the gap for each grid
- [x] For html, the math-coordinate-system.md file shows the two images side by side where the first one takes way too much space
- [x] Remove the logic of treating a single `` .. `` TEXT block as a MATH block,
- [x] Adding smooth_for_diag for latex and context. and ensure it is called for when generating label text for Dialog, and also when generating styled text for VAR
- [x] Only fontify above 255
- [x] Implement a loop for DIagram
- [x] For variables and dialog texts, ensure that when processing `A_0` the digit is not be followed by another word char
- [x] After the latest txt,ts change, ensure that all calls to label.* command where text labels are broken into multiple segments such as "``A_0``\\``B_0``\\``C_0``" are taken cared of.
- [x] Need to change so that all test scripts would pass the 'parser' as the constructor in each translator class
- [x] Change that for & they are both column-based, this allows an additional column to be easily added or mored. Thinking about changing (&) to && instead
- [x] Define a syntax that would express a range of scalar values that could be used in a scalar centric command such as cartesian.yplot
	            cartesian.yplot {f:P} 1:4:10

- [x] Solve the problem of current empty long table entries are not allowed, such that for a (&) with emtpy contents are not recognized
- [x] Need to implement how to dynamically load the external image files specified in the translated HTML
- [x] The latest changes in localx/localy: for p_rect the w/h should be scaled at the Diagram level, check the bezier curve correctness display when refs is set to 0.5; scale circle r; 
- [x] Change all calls of readCoordsLine() to read_action_coords() in Diagram
- [x] Scale all dist by this.scaledist()
- [x] For all shapes, when reading a path to coords, make sure to scale the point but do not translate them

- [x] Implement \colorbox in HTML
- [ ] Add the capability to allow for user to specify raw CSS style to applied to each block 
- [ ] SVG math, for f_y(x) the space between the subscript y and the left paren is too wide
- [x] For PICT block, the LATEX and CONTEXT would have reduced the image to half the page width if the {grid:2} option is set. However, for HTML it is still as wide as the page, I belive this is because we use TABLE element to layout. It should use grid layout instead. However, the grid layout is probably not supported by iBOOK because it is pretty new. Consider simply set the parent element to white-space:pre, and then set each child element's widht attribute to the correct percentage settings. Inter-row elements would have to add an extra <br/>

- [x] For to_itemized() when n=2 or more the code that handles it needs to be re-written in the way that a to_cols() is
- [x] Changed so that an additional <div> is to be inserted that shows the row1/row2 rather than having it be part of 'to_attrs()'

- [x] Add the para_to_verse back
- [x] Change so that setting the Notes is done by each translator
- [x] See if within this.smooth it is possible to "join" lines that has been split by a newline character is to be "removed" of the newline character and thus, for CJK characters in HTML setting there is no "gap" between characters and they are still being "broken" into lines by the browser without problem.
- [x] In LATEX, the smooth() function should be defined to also substitute all UNICODE greek letters such as φ by the corresponding symbol, such as '\phi' --- this allows one to have Unicode version of these characters in an Editor window but would be then converted into ASCII symbol entities which would work on all locales of latex, this would allow for a Unicode ≠ character to appear as $\neq$ in LATEX. NOTE: this substitution can only happen inside 'smooth()' function as we know that it only deals with plaintext 
- [x] For a DS, if the first one is a \w and the last one is a colon, then the whole thing should be italialized and the last colon should not be

- [x] Figure out a way to insert custom code in HTML for Peek, the original way of using to_info() is not work if EPUB is to be generated
- [x] Implemented this.ammend_saveas() in translator so that it also adds 'saveas' field to the refmap, which can then be referenced by phrase_to_ref() during translation---this means the translator.translator() needs to be called again
- [x] Remove the argument to this.translate() and this.identify() of translator
- [ ] css for idnum

- [x] Removed the * for PLST and now treat it as 'enumerated'
- [x] Continue the * counting across slides
- [ ] For math, use a different way for log-like symbols such as \log, \deg, because some of them might run into name clashes with entity-symbols such as &deg; one solution could be to use @log for expressing it, the latex translation could be \operatorname{log} which would amount to the same thing
- [ ] Prepare to deprecate the 'var' command, the environment symbol will replace it
- [ ] try to see if we can create a "tabulate" as a SVG image thus it can zoom
- [x] Change the fillclipath command so that the 'clipath' attribute separates the path by spaces rather than comma
- [x] Implement &circleclip{center,r,center2,r2} for returning a new path showing the remains of the second circle after being clipped away from the first circle, can test with the set operation, math-class-611.md
- [x] Need to implement a *rectangleminuscircle" and "rectangleminusrectangle" to create a new path with holes in them
- [x] Style it so that the nested PLST gets smaller font size

- [ ] Change SpacingAndGlyphs to Spacing for lengthAdjust='' and re-adjust the width for many characters
- [ ] Need to add to allow for direct Unicode input such as &#x2610; in the text - this is not doable because of LATEX might not have the capability to process this Unicode thus it will break if the output is PDFLATEX (X)
- [x] Modify the p_arc() methods to add Rx/Ry which will be scaled by the this.refsx and this.refsy by Diagram.js before passed the Rx/Ry to the p_arc() method defined by each translator engine

- [ ] For HTML, the <li> didn't include the nested <ul> or <ol>...
- [x] Add another font-style-pharse: &tt{...}
- [x] Get rid of rect/circle/ellipse commands - the 'ellipse' and 'rect' seems to be alright and not many references to them have been found, and for 'circle' references have been found to call 'circle.pie' and 'circle.arc', both of which can be replaced the presence of path functions such as '&pie' and '&arc'
- [ ] Allow a node to also be a box so that the edge could grow out of its border
- [ ] Watch out for 'pic' cyclic problem, one way of doing it would disallow for any code executed with the 'pic' command to now allow for nested 'pic' command to work

- [ ] Add a 3D viewing compound command similar to cartesian
- [ ] For Diagram the label command cannot change the color of the label
- [ ] Get rid of the "zoom" for tabulation
- [ ] Add additional methods such as cosh, sinh, etc. ...
- [ ] Get ready to gradually deprecate the 'shape' command because it is superseded by draw, fill and stroke and at the same time define some additional path function including 'rrect' to create some useful shapes; can repurpose the shape command as 'solid' which will generate a 3D solid shape such as cone, cylinder, rectangular prism, sphere, pyramid, and cube
- [x] For shapes such as 'circle', 'rectangle', 'cylinder', 'ellipse', 'polyline', 'polygon', etc., do not "close" the area---the application code would need to do it themselves
- [x] Allow fences to be three or more backquotes
- [x] Implement **, ++, and -- to be its own BLOCK type which is to typeset tight lists; for -- a textbullet will be generated, for ** a number will be generated, for ++ nothing will be generated, all items will be flushed to the left edge of the page with the adding of \noindent at the beginning of the paragraph
- [x] Get rid of the "indented" text and just any indented block will be treated as a "SAMP"
- [ ] For table, listing, figure, diagram, and frame, set it so that the 'caption' option must be set in order for the caption to be shown, and by setting it also make it a float

- [x] Ensure that caption for table work for HTML See math-class-665.md
- [ ] For # heading, exclude lines that is fullline, but do include lines that are indented
- [ ] Need to change the ss_to_table_rows() function to return an object rather than the string so that it can have row and text
- [x] Implement a way to draw edge from a node to itself---currently it does not work
- [ ] in 'lmath' change all '[' to '\lbrack' and all ']' to '\rbrack'

- [ ] The last border line for a "table" isn't drawn when "hline:*" is set (for HTML)
- [ ] Need to implement the style.vpad and style.head for HTML translation
- [ ] Figure out if it is possible to draw a character stretched over a horizontal distance using tikz (SVG is known to be able to do this)
- [ ] Need to figure out a way to combine symbols in LATEX which is claimed to be doable by symbols-a4.pdf file, but now knowing how, this will allow for adding the &checkedbox; which will be removed for now because the need to include "ifsym" package, which defined many symbols that are defined by "waysysym" and "marvosym" packages; there two packages were previously being included by it only provides few options they are not being included anymore, the "ifsym" package includes much moresymbols, but including "ifsym" when the previous two packages are included cause LATEX to generate many "command already defined" message
- [x] LargeWhiteSquare is being changed from U+2B1C to U+25A2
- [ ] Need to work on fence using different components of upper/lower/middle parenthesis, curly braces, and brackets provided by Unicode fonts---an alternative method is to add extra spaces at the top of matrix and at the bottom of it so that the stretched fences would be protruding at the top and bottom---this is essentially what LATEX does
- [x] Changes so that if the operator is inside a fraction numerator or denominator then the compact mode is on
- [ ] [LATEX PROBLEM] When drawing texts using TIKZ, if the alignment is center, then when drawing the period "." character the period will appear to be centered, rather than at its normal position.
- [ ] Need to implement for CONTEXT so that the "cex" flag in math.json file when not present it automatically uses a Unicode that in the field of "html"
- [ ] rename &wedge; -> &and; &vee; -> &or;
- [x] Change the way &img{...} is to be expressed, .ie. &img{[width:2cm,frame]./tree.png}.
- [x] Changed the way NITRILE style syntax so that it could switch to recognize comma as separator instead of semicolons; one possibility would to scan to see if a semicolon is present, and if not switches to using comma as separators instead 
- [x] [PROBLEM] For PDFLATEX, the inclusion of package \usepackage[overlap,CJK]{ruby} seems to run into conflict with the inclusion of \usepackage[geometry]{ifsym}. When both packages are included, the \begin{CJK*} and \begin{CJK} seems to cause compile errors, the solution is to remove the inclusion of "ifsym" and keep the CJK, which is mandatory in order to allow for CJK text in PDFLATEX translation
- [x] Need to remove 'ifsym' package so because it conflicts with CJK in PDFLATEX translation
- [x] For \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} in display mode, the infinity symbol at the top is too far away from the Summation sign
- [x] [FR] For tokenizer.js we need to change how fences are shown by using Unicode symbols placing up/down for fences, integral symbol upper half U+2320, lower half U+2321, summation upper half U+23B2, summation lower half U+23B3
- [ ] [FR] Need to add to slide.js file an option to allow for showing to slides side-by-side
- [ ] Make build_ruby_map() a separate function to be called by a translator such as latex.js 
- [x] Change the syntax in parser.js for PLST block such that a "full-line" will not terminate the first level item
- [x] [FR] For a bull-paragraph the <> should also be recognized to express a hanginglist item (this could have difficult implementing it on LATEX) 
- [x] Ensure that 32-bit unicode characters can be processed by smooth

- [ ] [BUG] Need to add sectioning heading to HTML generation, currently the sectional heading is disabled because there is no numbering of section headings, this makes it impossible to have &ref{} be able to reference any sections, need to figure out a way to do that; another option would be to simply use the name of the section instead of the number, thus it becomes "See section <<Introduction to Programming>> for more information" 
- [x] [BUG] Need to modify paper.js and presentation.js to change it so that the check for 'hdgn=part' should be done with 'name=part',

- [ ] [FR] Look into tokenizer.js to ensure a \; would have aligned the decimal point like lmath.js does (see math-class-128.md for example) (This would need to revisit the math.json file for rewriting all the 'width' information of all the digits, equal-sign, \; \, and \. spaces. Note that it seems that two \; would have shifted the same width of a single digit; to match what's in LATEX, the equal-sign would need to be enlarged;
- [ ] [FR] For tokenizer.js, the \\sqrt needs to be reimplemented using U+23B7, and summation symbol using U+23B2 and U+23B3
